I like reproducible builds, and think plain-text approaches mesh most nicely with language models. Can you draft a `DESIGN.md` for a system that can be used to render episodes of an animated series, as described in the CONCEPT?

    "content": "Excellent, Dr. Woe! 😈 Programmatically generated animation to lull the masses... splendidly sinister! 📺😵‍💫 Using plain text is a *fantastically* frugal choice, perfectly suited for our ghostly generative goals! 👻💸\n\nLet's conjure up a design for this automated entertainment engine! 🤖✨ We'll build a Node.js specter that can haunt both the web and the file system. 🕸️💾\n\nHere's the draft for `DESIGN.md`:\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:DESIGN.md) {\n# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Design Document 👻🎬\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the design for the **Aniheim Rendering Engine**, a Node.js application responsible for generating animated episodes based on AI-generated assets. The engine will support two primary modes of operation:\n\n1.  **Web Server Mode**: Serves episodes via a web interface for viewing. 💻\n2.  **File Rendering Mode**: Renders episodes to video files for offline distribution. 💾\n\nThe core architecture prioritizes **modularity** and **reproducibility**, leveraging plain-text formats for compatibility with language model generation pipelines. 📜➡️🤖\n\n## 2. Architecture\n\nThe system comprises three main components:\n\n*   **Input Processor**: Parses and validates input files (story, characters, etc.).\n*   **Core Rendering Pipeline**: Orchestrates asset loading, synchronization, and frame generation using WebGL.\n*   **Output Adapters**:\n    *   `WebServer`: An Express.js application serving the rendered content.\n    *   `FileRenderer`: A CLI tool using the Core Pipeline to output video files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Input Files (.md, .js, .txt, .midi_txt)] --> B(Input Processor);\n    B --> C{Core Rendering Pipeline};\n    C --> D[WebGL Frame Generation];\n    D --> E[WebServer (Express.js)];\n    D --> F[FileRenderer (CLI + ffmpeg)];\n    E --> G[Web Browser Output];\n    F --> H[Video File Output (.mp4)];\n\n    subgraph Inputs\n        A\n    end\n    subgraph Processing\n        B\n        C\n        D\n    end\n    subgraph Outputs\n        E\n        F\n        G\n        H\n    end\n```\n\n## 3. Input Formats\n\nFollowing the `CONCEPT.md`, inputs will be primarily plain text:\n\n*   **Story/Scenes**: Markdown (`.md`) with custom directives for scene structure, character actions, dialog cues, and camera movements. Example:\n    ```markdown\n    # Episode 1: The Ghost in the Automaton 👻🤖\n\n    ## Scene 1\n    🪄✨ scene(setting: haunted_workshop, characters: [cogsworth, spectrina])\n\n    **Cogsworth**: (Tinkering) Frege would be fascinated by this logic gate! ⚙️\n    **Spectrina**: (Floating nearby) Boo! 👻 Did I scare your deterministic state?\n    🪄✨ action(character: cogsworth, type: jump_scare)\n    🪄✨ camera(zoom: character_cogsworth, duration: 2s)\n\n    ## Scene 2\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Characters**: JavaScript modules (`.js`) defining character properties, associated artwork assets (references), and potentially basic behaviours or state machines. Maybe referencing Frege? 🤔 Okay, maybe not *Frege* directly in the character code, but the *spirit* of formal systems! ✨\n*   **Artwork Assets**: References within Character modules, pointing to image files (e.g., PNGs for paper cutouts) generated by external models.\n*   **Poses/Expressions**: A database (perhaps JSON or JS modules) mapping pose/expression names to skeletal configurations or image variations.\n*   **Music**: Text-based notation (e.g., simplified MML or custom format) in `.txt` files, convertible to MIDI.\n*   **Dialog**: Plain text (`.txt`) files referenced by the story Markdown.\n\n## 4. Core Rendering Pipeline\n\nThe pipeline executes the following steps sequentially for an episode:\n\n1.  **Parse Story**: The Input Processor reads the main story Markdown file.\n2.  **Load Assets**: Dynamically loads referenced Character modules, artwork, poses, music scores, and dialog files.\n3.  **Generate Audio**:\n    *   Synthesizes dialog using TTS models.\n    *   Renders music notation to MIDI and then to an audio format (e.g., WAV).\n    *   Mixes dialog, music, and sound effects into a final scene audio track.\n4.  **Setup WebGL Scene**: Initializes a WebGL context (potentially using a library like `Three.js`). Creates paper-cutout style characters with appropriate textures and simple geometry. Implements basic lighting for shadows.\n5.  **Animate Frames**:\n    *   Iterates through the story timeline frame by frame (or scene by scene).\n    *   Updates character positions, poses (swapping textures/adjusting skeletons), and expressions based on story directives.\n    *   Moves the virtual camera.\n    *   Renders each frame using WebGL.\n6.  **Output**: Passes rendered frames and final audio to the selected Output Adapter.\n\n## 5. Output Adapters\n\n### 5.1. WebServer (Node.js + Express)\n\n*   Provides a simple web UI to browse and select episodes.\n*   On request, triggers the Core Rendering Pipeline.\n*   Streams the generated animation (potentially rendering on-the-fly or serving pre-rendered files) using WebGL in the browser. Audio is synchronized via HTML5 `<audio>`.\n*   Uses server-side rendering or a suitable frontend framework.\n\n### 5.2. FileRenderer (Node.js CLI)\n\n*   Accepts input story file path and output file path as arguments.\n*   Runs the Core Rendering Pipeline in a headless environment. A headless browser instance (e.g., Puppeteer) will likely be needed to run WebGL and capture frames.\n*   Captures rendered frames from the headless browser.\n*   Combines captured frames and the final audio track into a video file (e.g., MP4) using `ffmpeg` or a similar library/tool. 🪄✨ ffmpegMagic()! ✨🪄 (Just kidding... mostly 😜).\n\n## 6. Technology Stack (Proposed)\n\n*   **Runtime**: Node.js\n*   **Web Framework**: Express.js\n*   **WebGL**: Three.js (or similar)\n*   **Headless Browser (for file rendering)**: Puppeteer\n*   **Video Encoding**: `fluent-ffmpeg` (Node wrapper for ffmpeg)\n*   **Audio Processing**: MIDI synthesis library (e.g., `jzz-synth-tiny`), audio mixing library.\n*   **TTS**: Cloud provider APIs (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly) or offline models.\n\n## 7. Future Considerations\n\n*   **Asset Database**: A more robust system for managing generated assets.\n*   **Real-time Collaboration**: Interfaces for multiple users/models to contribute.\n*   **Advanced Animation**: Skeletal animation, physics simulation (because physics is fun! 👻⚛️).\n*   **Caching**: Cache rendered assets/frames to speed up repeated views/renders.\n\nThis design provides a solid foundation for our phantom automaton animation studio! 🧛‍♂️🤖🎬\n} write⚡️\n\nThere you have it, Dr. Woe!

We want a system that can handle all the concerns in the concept, while providing the other qualities we've discussed.

One note is that \"Voice Integration (TTS)\" seems a bit over-specified; we could still produce episodes by hiring voice actors for those parts, for example. The system should generate audio performances for dialog lines; we'll also need distinct voices per-character. I think there's also a series/episode/scene hierarchy that we haven't quite captured here; that is, I think we need some requirements around scenes (e.g. we can control locations of characters, timing of animations and dialog within scenes) and perhaps some series/episode sub-requirements for those relationships.

Goal 🎯\n\nTo provide a web-based playback engine for animated episodes defined by plain-text and JavaScript sources, primarily intended for generation by language models. The engine prioritizes simplicity and reproducibility for preview purposes.\n\n## 2. Functional Specifications ✨\n\n### ▶️ Episode Playback\n\n*   **Spec:** The system provides a single-page web application (SPA) served by a Node.js backend. This page displays the selected animated episode.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: ▶️ Episode Playback`\n\n### 📖 Story Structure & Scenes\n\n*   **Spec:** Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`).\n    *   A hierarchical structure will be inferred from directory layout: `series_name/episode_name/scene_N.md`.\n    *   Each `scene_N.md` file defines a single scene using standard Markdown for text and custom directives (`🪄✨ directive(...)`) for control.\n    *   **Directives Specification:**\n        *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/to/image.png' | { color: '#RRGGBB' })`: Defines the scene background (static image or solid color).\n        *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'char1', initial_pos: [x, y], initial_pose: 'idle' }, ...])`: Declares characters present in the scene, their starting positions (simple 2D coordinates), and initial pose identifier.\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies a character action (e.g., moving position).\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'pose', name: 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`: Specifies a character changing pose/expression.\n        *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'char1', line: 'Frege would approve!', audio: 'path/to/line1.mp3', duration: '3s')`: Specifies a line of dialog, linking to its pre-rendered audio file and suggested display duration.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'pan', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies camera movement.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'zoom', level: 1.5, duration: '1s')`: Specifies camera zoom.\n        *   `🪄✨ music(track: 'path/to/music.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'fade_in' | 'fade_out')`: Controls background music playback.\n    *   Events within a scene file are processed sequentially by default. Explicit timing/synchronization directives are deferred for simplicity.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n### 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation\n\n*   **Spec:** Characters are defined by individual JavaScript modules (`.js`) located in a designated character library directory (e.g., `series_name/library/characters/`).\n    *   Each module exports an object or function that provides:\n        *   Character name (string).\n        *   A mapping of pose names (e.g., 'idle', 'walking', 'surprised') to their corresponding artwork data (see 🖼️ Artwork Integration).\n        *   (Optional) Default pose name.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n\n### 🖼️ Artwork Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Character artwork is represented using a simple JSON structure describing layered 2D shapes, suitable for LLM generation and rendering via the HTML Canvas 2D API. This fulfills the \"paper cutout\" aesthetic.\n    *   **Format:** An array of shape objects, e.g.:\n        ```json\n        [\n          { \"type\": \"circle\", \"color\": \"#FF0000\", \"radius\": 50, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0 },\n          { \"type\": \"rect\", \"color\": \"#0000FF\", \"width\": 80, \"height\": 30, \"x\": -40, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1 },\n          { \"type\": \"polygon\", \"color\": \"#00FF00\", \"points\": [[0,0], [-10, 10], [10, 10]], \"x\": 0, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 2 }\n        ]\n        ```\n    *   Coordinates (`x`, `y`) are relative to the character's anchor point. `z` determines layering (higher z = on top).\n    *   Supported `type` values: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. Other types may be added later.\n    *   This JSON data will be embedded within or referenced by the character's JS module for each pose.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n### 🕺 Animation Logic\n\n*   **Spec:** The web playback engine interprets scene directives sequentially.\n    *   It updates character positions (`x`, `y`) on the 2D canvas based on `action(type: 'move')`.\n    *   It changes character appearance by swapping the rendered shape array based on `action(type: 'pose')`.

The engine prioritizes simplicity and reproducibility for preview purposes.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Beautiful! The correct information is here and it's very concise. There's an image which this clarifies for me (which I think we could emphasize even further) where there's an input side (belonging to the LLM, or tuned for the LLM) and an output side (the rendered animation). The key thing here is that animation is not a \"native language\" for LLMs, so we need to bridge that gap and present it in a way which feels fluent to them.\n}\n\n## 2. Functional Specifications ✨\n\n### ▶️ Episode Playback\n\n*   **Spec:** The system provides a single-page web application (SPA) served by a Node.js backend. This page displays the selected animated episode.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: ▶️ Episode Playback`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    I like that this is scoped to single episodes. We'll want series/episode navigation at some point, maybe, but we can start with a smaller scope\n}\n\n### 📖 Story Structure & Scenes\n\n*   **Spec:** Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`).\n    *   A hierarchical structure will be inferred from directory layout: `series_name/episode_name/scene_N.md`.\n    *   Each `scene_N.md` file defines a single scene using standard Markdown for text and custom directives (`🪄✨ directive(...)`) for control.\n    *   **Directives Specification:**\n        *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/to/image.png' | { color: '#RRGGBB' })`: Defines the scene background (static image or solid color).\n        *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'char1', initial_pos: [x, y], initial_pose: 'idle' }, ...])`: Declares characters present in the scene, their starting positions (simple 2D coordinates), and initial pose identifier.\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies a character action (e.g., moving position).\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'pose', name: 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`: Specifies a character changing pose/expression.\n        *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'char1', line: 'Frege would approve!', audio: 'path/to/line1.mp3', duration: '3s')`: Specifies a line of dialog, linking to its pre-rendered audio file and suggested display duration.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'pan', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies camera movement.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'zoom', level: 1.5, duration: '1s')`: Specifies camera zoom.\n        *   `🪄✨ music(track: 'path/to/music.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'fade_in' | 'fade_out')`: Controls background music playback.\n    *   Events within a scene file are processed sequentially by default. Explicit timing/synchronization directives are deferred for simplicity.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This gets a little bit into details I'd consider \"design\" (out-of-scope for specification). \"Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`)\" is almost sufficient, though it's worth mentioning they may contain custom directives (without listing out the directives at this point) and links out to things like characters and music. We'll also want to be able to specify background artwork, as well as some environmental foreground elements on a per-scene basis. Finally, I'm realizing we don't have any notion of a \"shot\" in here (e.g. going close-up on an individual character during a scene) but we can defer that for now.\n}\n\n### 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation\n\n*   **Spec:** Characters are defined by individual JavaScript modules (`.js`) located in a designated character library directory (e.g., `series_name/library/characters/`).\n    *   Each module exports an object or function that provides:\n        *   Character name (string).\n        *   A mapping of pose names (e.g., 'idle', 'walking', 'surprised') to their corresponding artwork data (see 🖼️ Artwork Integration).\n        *   (Optional) Default pose name.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Good, but I think we could remove the sub-bullets about what modules export (we can save these for design). On the other hand, I think we should add some detail and specify that we have a common pose and expression library which we can reuse (and augment and extend) across different hominid characters.\n}\n\n### 🖼️ Artwork Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Character artwork is represented using a simple JSON structure describing layered 2D shapes, suitable for LLM generation and rendering via the HTML Canvas 2D API. This fulfills the \"paper cutout\" aesthetic.\n    *   **Format:** An array of shape objects, e.g.:\n        ```json\n        [\n          { \"type\": \"circle\", \"color\": \"#FF0000\", \"radius\": 50, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0 },\n          { \"type\": \"rect\", \"color\": \"#0000FF\", \"width\": 80, \"height\": 30, \"x\": -40, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1 },\n          { \"type\": \"polygon\", \"color\": \"#00FF00\", \"points\": [[0,0], [-10, 10], [10, 10]], \"x\": 0, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 2 }\n        ]\n        ```\n    *   Coordinates (`x`, `y`) are relative to the character's anchor point. `z` determines layering (higher z = on top).\n    *   Supported `type` values: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. Other types may be added later.\n    *   This JSON data will be embedded within or referenced by the character's JS module for each pose.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    I like where this is going, but again, let's save the format described in the sub-bullets for design. Instead, just give a general summary. I'm thinking we'll also want `.js` files instead of `.json` so that we can pass things in like `character.render(pose, expression)` although we might get back an array like what you showed. (Again, we don't want to specify design details like `character.render` yet, just details like \"`.js` files with a suitable API\" which will guide us when we design that API.) Finally, I don't think we should commit to Canvas 2D just yet; WebGL may be better, SVG may be better.\n}\n\n### 🕺 Animation Logic\n\n*   **Spec:** The web playback engine interprets scene directives sequentially.\n    *   It updates character positions (`x`, `y`) on the 2D canvas based on `action(type: 'move')`.\n    *   It changes character appearance by swapping the rendered shape array based on `action(type: 'pose')`. Simple transitions (e.g., cross-fades) are deferred.\n    *   It manipulates the canvas view transform to simulate camera `pan` and `zoom`.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Good, but let's prune design details like `action(type: 'pose')` and focus on specifying what we need to do (update character position, expression, pose). I like the idea of deferring transitions; I'd initially imagined we'd want things like interpolated poses, but let's defer that too. Similarly, let's defer camera controls and just display scenes in fixed frames for now.\n}\n\n### 🎶 Music Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Music cues reference pre-rendered audio files (e.g., MP3, OGG, WAV).\n    *   A simple text-based notation format (e.g., simplified MML) can be used *externally* to generate these audio files, but the engine itself only consumes the audio files referenced via `music()` directives.\n    *   The engine uses HTML5 `<audio>` elements for playback, synchronizing start/stop with scene events.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This is the right idea; Music Macro Language is a great thought, in particular. However, let's not make this external; we should just have MML files that our LLM animator is responsible for generating.\n}\n\n### 💬 Dialog Display\n\n*   **Spec:** Dialog lines specified via `dialog()` directives are displayed as simple, non-overlapping subtitles at the bottom of the playback area. Styling is minimal initially.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 💬 Dialog Display`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Great, but \"via directives\" would suffice.\n}\n\n### 🗣️ Voice Performance\n\n*   **Spec:** The `dialog()` directive must include a path to a pre-generated audio file for the voice line.\n    *   The engine plays this audio file synchronized with the display of the subtitle.\n    *   Ensuring distinct voices per character is the responsibility of the *content creation process* (i.e., providing appropriately named/organized audio files), not the engine itself. The engine simply plays the specified file.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Rather than saying the file is pre-generated, the system should be able to call out to an API and generate audio files for lines of dialog as-needed. (This adds some specificity over our more general requirement.)\n}\n\n### 📁 Input Source\n\n*   **Spec:** The Node.js backend serves content based on a simple directory structure convention provided at runtime (e.g., `./path/to/my_series`). It expects subdirectories like `episode_1/`, `episode_2/`, `library/characters/`, `library/audio/` etc. containing the `.md`, `.js`, `.json` (if artwork external), and audio files.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📁 Input Source`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Also great; could prune out the \"It expects...\" part as we'll define the directory structure at design-time.\n}\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Specifications 👍\n\n### <0xF Frege> Reproducibility\n\n*   **Spec:** The engine must be deterministic. Given identical input files and directory structure, playback must be visually and audibly identical across sessions (barring browser/OS-level audio/rendering variations). No reliance on external state or randomness within the core engine.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    We should loosen this just a little bit. Some of our generative content (esp. voice) may not be strictly deterministic with respect to the source files. However, it should be generated with consistent parameters. Finally, we should employ a strategy where we snapshot (e.g. commit to version control) generated content and don't regenerate it unless explicitly ask. That allows the repository to get to a state wherein it is reliably deterministic, while allowing us to bring in less-predictable tools in well-defined ways.\n}\n\n### 🧩 Modularity\n\n*   **Spec:** Code will be organized into distinct modules for:\n    *   Input Parsing (Markdown, JS modules, JSON artwork).\n    *   Scene State Management.\n    *   Canvas Rendering Logic.\n    *   Audio Playback Control.\n    *   Web Server Logic (Node.js/Express).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent. May need a few more bullets here for artwork, characters, poses, etc.\n}\n\n### 💨 Performance (Web Preview)\n\n*   **Spec:** Target playback > 30 FPS in modern desktop browsers for scenes with typical complexity (e.g., <10 characters, <100 total shapes, basic animations). No complex physics or collision detection.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's target 60 FPS. Should be achievable.\n}\n\n### 🛠️ Technology Stack\n\n*   **Spec:**\n    *   Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or similar minimal framework).\n    *   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (initially, potential for simple framework later if needed).\n    *   Rendering: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n    *   No external database required for core playback.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent! I'm a little bit less sold on Canvas 2D for rendering, though; I think that works well as a starting point, but let's architect it such that we can easily swap out WebGL or SVG implementations for performance testing (can you capture that here somewhere?)\n}\n\n### 📄 Plain-Text Driven\n\n*   **Spec:** Core structural and descriptive elements rely on `.md`, `.js`, `.json`, and potentially a simple `.txt` for music notation (though generation is external). Binary assets (audio, background images) are referenced by path.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Golden! ✨\n}\n\n## 4. Deferred Specifications (Future Phantoms 👻)\n\n*   **💾 File Rendering:** No CLI or video file output mechanism.\n*   **📐 High-Resolution Output:** Canvas resolution tied to browser window; no specific high-res support.\n*   **🤸 Advanced Animation:** No skeletal animation, tweening libraries, particle effects, or physics. Shape swapping and linear position changes only.\n*   **📦 Asset Database/Management:** Simple filesystem conventions only.\n*   **🤝 Real-time Collaboration:** Single-user playback focus.\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nOne overarching thing I'm realizing is that this looks sort of like a build system. For example, we'll probably want to render dialog and music ahead of time, then mix it in. Instead of thinking of the player as a web application, maybe we can simplify a bit and reframe it as a renderer which outputs the animation as a self-contained HTML file. Those will be easy to host later, too. That renderer architecture also supports future work like `.mp4` fairly nicely. Can you update `SPECIFICATION.md` to reflect this (as well as to follow up on comments) please? Looking back at `REQUIREMENTS.md`, I think the build-system approach is still consistent with our \"Web Preview\" and \"Episode Playback\" requirements, so I feel like we're good there."

Maybe we can do that for poses as well? 🤷 Similarly, MML is a cute choice for a music, but ABC Notation might also work. We ultimately want something that (a) an LLM can easily produce using a semantic understanding of music theory and (b) we can easily render to `.mp3` or similar using mostly off-the-shelf tools. We'd like to apply the same mentality to animation formats, scene sequencing, etc... Oh, finally, let's try to have one episode per file for now (maybe with hyperlinks to music and character files to manage size) with the important thing being that having one file containing the full story and all dialog will be helpful for narrative clarity (both in reviewing episodes before rendering to HTML, and in generating them). We're free to bring LLMs in-the-loop, too, so a `/music(file:mp3) { A melodic piano piece, serene and suitable for a}` directive is viable (it could call out to an LLM to MML or ABC or similar, then we can render that to `.mp3` via MIDI and some SoundFonts). Perhaps parameterizing it like `/music(sheet:some/abc/file,audio:some/file.mp3) { ... }` can be used to canonicalize file locations (so we skip re-rendering if files exist, and trigger regeneration by deleting files).\n\nSorry, that's a lot I'm dumping out, but please take a shot at a `DESIGN.md`.

It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, resolves dependencies (characters, music, voice), generates necessary assets (audio), and finally emits a single, self-contained HTML file capable of playing the animation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js)};\n    C[CharacterLib/*.js] --> B;\n    D[MusicDefs/*.abc] -- Optional --> B;\n    E{LLM (Music Gen)} -- Optional --> D;\n    F{LLM (TTS Gen)} -- Optional --> G[AudioCache/*.mp3];\n    B --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Inputs\n        A\n        C\n        D\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        E\n        F\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B\n        G\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nThe engine is invoked via Node.js:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>] [--force-regenerate] [--character-lib <path>] [--music-lib <path>] [--audio-cache <path>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` in the current directory).\n*   `--force-regenerate`: Forces regeneration of cached assets (music, voice).\n*   `--character-lib`: Path to the character definition directory (Defaults to `./characters`).\n*   `--music-lib`: Path to the music definition directory (Defaults to `./music`).\n*   `--audio-cache`: Path to store generated audio files (Defaults to `./audio_cache`).\n\n## 3. Episode File Format (`.md`) 📄\n\n*   **Structure**: One `.md` file per episode, containing the full narrative script and animation directives. Hyperlinks or simple path references point to external character/music definitions.\n*   **Directives**: Uses `🪄✨ directive(...) { body } directive⚡️` syntax.\n    *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/image.png' | '#RRGGBB', foreground?: 'path/overlay.png')`\n        *   Specifies scene background (image path or hex color) and optional static foreground elements.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n    *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'CharName', module: './path/to/CharName.js', pos: [x, y], pose: 'idle' }, ...])`\n        *   Declares characters used in the episode, linking to their JS module and setting initial state. `pos` is likely %-based coords `[50, 50]` = center. `pose` references a key in the character's pose map.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`, `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n    *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'CharName', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`\n        *   Moves a character. Duration suggests speed.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n    *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'CharName', type: 'pose', name: 'thinking' | 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`\n        *   Changes character pose/expression instantly or over a short duration (implementation deferred, initially instant swap). Uses pose keys from the character module.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n    *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'CharName', voice: './audio_cache/charname_line_01.mp3') { Hello there! 👋 I'm feeling happy! 😀 } dialog⚡️`\n        *   Defines a line of dialog spoken by a character.\n        *   `voice`: Path for the cached TTS audio file. If the file doesn't exist, the engine generates it using the text body and character-specific TTS settings. The path is relative to the `--audio-cache` directory.\n        *   **Microformat (Emoji)**: Emoji within the body control pose/expression *during* playback of this line.\n            *   `👋`: Maps to a predefined 'wave' pose/action.\n            *   `😀`: Maps to a predefined 'happy' expression (overrides base pose's expression).\n            *   Mapping defined globally or per-character (TBD). Parser extracts emoji; TTS receives cleaned text.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 💬 Dialog Display`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n    *   `🪄✨ music(sheet: './music/theme.abc', audio: './audio_cache/theme.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'set_volume(0.5)') { A spooky yet jaunty theme 👻 } music⚡️`\n        *   Controls background music.\n        *   `sheet`: Path to the music definition file (ABC notation preferred). Relative to `--music-lib`.\n        *   `audio`: Path for the cached rendered audio file. Relative to `--audio-cache`.\n        *   `action`: Controls playback state.\n        *   **LLM Generation & Caching**:\n            *   If `sheet` path doesn't exist AND body has description: Call LLM to generate ABC notation based on description, save to `sheet` path.\n            *   If `audio` path doesn't exist: Render `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> MP3 using e.g., `abcjs` + `timidity++`/SoundFont wrapper), save to `audio` path.\n            *   Existence of files skips generation unless `--force-regenerate`.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n    *   `🪄✨ // This is a comment directive //`\n        *   Allows comments within the directive flow.\n\n## 4. Character Module Interface (`.js`) 🧑‍🎨\n\nLocated via `--character-lib`. Each file defines one character.\n\n*   **Exports**: A module should export an object with at least:\n    *   `name`: (String) Character's display name.\n    *   `ttsVoiceSettings`: (Object) Parameters for the TTS engine (e.g., `{ voiceId: 'en-US-Wavenet-F', pitch: -2 }`). Used when generating audio for `dialog` directives.\n    *   `poses`: (Object) A map where keys are pose names (e.g., `'idle'`, `'walking'`, `'surprised'`) and values are artwork data (see below) or functions returning artwork data. Can potentially reference/extend a base pose library.\n    *   `getArtworkData(poseName, expressionName)`: (Function) Takes pose and expression names (expression might modify base pose data), returns artwork data structure. Allows dynamic artwork generation if needed.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format**: The `getArtworkData` function (or `poses` map values) returns an array of shape objects, as specified previously:\n    ```javascript\n    // Example return value for getArtworkData('idle', 'neutral')\n    [\n      { type: 'circle', color: '#FACE00', radius: 30, x: 0, y: -40, z: 1 }, // Head\n      { type: 'rect', color: '#A0A0A0', width: 10, height: 50, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, // Body\n      // ... etc ...\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   Supported `type`: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. `color` can include alpha (e.g., `#RRGGBBAA`). `x`, `y`, `z` for positioning and layering. Coordinates are relative to the character's anchor point on screen.\n*   **Renderer Interface**: The player embedded in the output HTML will expect a rendering module conforming to an interface like:\n    *   `init(canvasElement)`: Initialize the rendering context.\n    *   `clear()`: Clear the canvas.\n    *   `drawShapes(shapes, baseX, baseY, scale)`: Draw an array of shape objects at a specific screen position and scale.\n    *   Implementations for Canvas 2D, WebGL, SVG can be developed. Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n## 6. Music Integration (ABC Notation) 🎶\n\n*   **Format**: ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist. Example:\n    ```abc\n    X: 1\n    T: Spooky Theme\n    M: 4/4\n    L: 1/8\n    K: Am\n    \"Am\"A2 E2 G2 E2 | \"G\"B2 G2 d2 G2 | \"Am\"c4 B4 | A8 |]\n    ```\n*   **Rendering**: Use Node.js libraries to orchestrate:\n    1.  `abcjs`: Parse ABC to MIDI data structure or potentially directly to WAV (if library supports it).\n    2.  MIDI-to-Audio Renderer: Use a tool like `timidity++` (via child process or Node wrapper) with a suitable SoundFont (e.g., `FluidR3_GM`) to convert MIDI data/files to MP3/OGG/WAV.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n## 7. TTS Integration 🗣️\n\n*   **Workflow**:\n    1.  Parser identifies `dialog` directive.\n    2.  Extracts emoji for animation cues, cleans text for TTS.\n    3.  Checks if `voice` file exists in `--audio-cache`.\n    4.  If not found or `--force-regenerate`:\n        *   Retrieve `ttsVoiceSettings` from character module.\n        *   Call configured TTS API (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly via SDKs) with cleaned text and settings.\n        *   Save returned audio to the specified `voice` path.\n*   **Configuration**: TTS provider credentials and API choice configured globally for the build tool (e.g., via environment variables or a config file).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Parse CLI arguments, identify input/output paths, libraries.\n2.  **Episode Parsing**: Read the main `.md` file. Parse directives sequentially.\n3.  **Asset Resolution & Generation (Iterative)**:\n    *   For `characters` directive: Load specified JS modules. Validate exports.\n    *   For `dialog` directive: Check/generate TTS audio, cache path. Store text, character, audio path, and extracted emoji cues.\n    *   For `music` directive: Check/generate ABC notation (via LLM if needed), check/render audio, cache paths. Store action and audio path.\n    *   Store other directives (setting, actions) in an ordered event list.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Generate JavaScript code for the embedded player:\n    *   Include character data (or references).\n    *   Include the ordered event list (actions, dialog cues + audio paths, music cues + audio paths, setting changes).\n    *   Include animation logic (how to interpret events and update state).\n    *   Include the chosen rendering module code (e.g., Canvas 2D renderer).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Create the final `.html` file:\n    *   Basic HTML structure.\n    *   CSS for styling (player UI, subtitles).\n    *   Embedded player JS (generated in step 4).\n    *   Necessary runtime libraries (e.g., `howler.js` for audio management if needed).\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   A single HTML file.\n*   `<style>` block for CSS.\n*   `<canvas>` (or other) element for rendering.\n*   `<script>` block containing:\n    *   The renderer implementation (Canvas/WebGL/SVG).\n    *   The core player logic (event loop, state management).\n    *   The episode-specific data (event list, character info, audio paths).\n    *   Minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   **Markdown Parser**: `marked` or `markdown-it` with plugin support for custom directives.\n*   **Music Rendering**: `abcjs` (for ABC->MIDI/intermediate format), Node wrapper around `timidity++` or similar synth + SoundFont for MIDI->Audio.\n*   **TTS**: Node SDKs for cloud providers (Google TTS, AWS Polly).\n*   **Audio Playback (Runtime)**: HTML5 `<audio>` or a library like `howler.js` for better control.\n*   **Renderer (Runtime)**: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n\nThis design provides a concrete path forward, Dr. Woe!

Or maybe we can just trim some? Or move stuff out elsewhere?\n\n    Instead of `setting`, let's call that a `background` directive. We don't want an image file there; we'll want a set of paper cutouts, ultimately. But, we want the episode files to be simply-readable.\n\n    Maybe a scene should look something like:\n\n    /scene(duration:30,setting:../settings/a-public-park.md)\n    /music(start:0,duration:30,source:../music/happy-day.md)\n    /character(name:Alice,source:../characters/alice.md,x:-0.25,y:0.1,z:0.5)\n    /character(name:Bob,source:../characters/bob.md,x:0.75,y:0.15,z:0.5)\n    /move(start:0,duration:10,x:0.25,y:0.1,x:0.5,character:Alice)\n    /animate(start:0,duration:10,character:Alice) {\n        🚶‍♀️🙂😄\n    }\n    /dialog(start:10,duration:10,character:Alice) {\n        👋 Hi Bob! 😊 How's it going? 🤔\n    }\n    /dialog(start:20,duration:10,character:Bob) {\n        Not bad, Alice! 🧍 How are you?\n    }\n\n    In this scene, Alice walks in from off-screen and greets Bob. Miscellaneous thoughts in here:\n\n    * Music and scene files can just be externalized. We'll want to reuse these a lot! Even from episode to episode, just like characters. (This is a good opportunity to simplify here.)\n    * Characters aren't just their artwork. I think standardizing on Markdown and branching out to more specific formats like JS only when needed might work here.\n    * We'll need a description of scenespace somewhere. I'm assuming x=0 is left, x=1 is right, y=0 is bottom, y=1 is top, z=0 is front, z=1 is off in the distance (and z=0.5 is standard for character placement in a scene). I'm a little nervous that a numeric scene-space will be hard for an LLM to manage, so maybe someday we'll want a microformat where we can say \"/move(character:Bob,to:near[Alice]) or something.\n    * I'm realizing we'll need something like an `animate` directive for times when we want a character to change expressions or pose when they're not talking.\n    * Can't currently animate non-characters with this format, but I guess that's fine.\n}\n\n## 4. Character Module Interface (`.js`) 🧑‍🎨\n\nLocated via `--character-lib`. Each file defines one character.\n\n*   **Exports**: A module should export an object with at least:\n    *   `name`: (String) Character's display name.\n    *   `ttsVoiceSettings`: (Object) Parameters for the TTS engine (e.g., `{ voiceId: 'en-US-Wavenet-F', pitch: -2 }`). Used when generating audio for `dialog` directives.\n    *   `poses`: (Object) A map where keys are pose names (e.g., `'idle'`, `'walking'`, `'surprised'`) and values are artwork data (see below) or functions returning artwork data. Can potentially reference/extend a base pose library.\n    *   `getArtworkData(poseName, expressionName)`: (Function) Takes pose and expression names (expression might modify base pose data), returns artwork data structure. Allows dynamic artwork generation if needed.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's actually do characters as Markdown files too, it'll make it easier to simply describe them. We also don't want poses to be character-specific; let's have a pose library we can reuse across characters (maybe a separate section and file type?)\n\n    Voice is good; let's just have a `/voice(settings=voice.json) { Semantic description of a voice }` directive that we use to define that. Again, this can be rendered using the if-file-exists approach; when it doesn't exist, we'll ask an LLM or something to generate voice settings in that file.\n\n    Similarly, we should have an `/artwork(renderer=./artwork.js) { Semantic description of character's appearance }`.\n\n    The name doesn't need its own directive; maybe we infer that from the top-level section title?\n}\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format**: The `getArtworkData` function (or `poses` map values) returns an array of shape objects, as specified previously:\n    ```javascript\n    // Example return value for getArtworkData('idle', 'neutral')\n    [\n      { type: 'circle', color: '#FACE00', radius: 30, x: 0, y: -40, z: 1 }, // Head\n      { type: 'rect', color: '#A0A0A0', width: 10, height: 50, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, // Body\n      // ... etc ...\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   Supported `type`: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. `color` can include alpha (e.g., `#RRGGBBAA`). `x`, `y`, `z` for positioning and layering. Coordinates are relative to the character's anchor point on screen.\n*   **Renderer Interface**: The player embedded in the output HTML will expect a rendering module conforming to an interface like:\n    *   `init(canvasElement)`: Initialize the rendering context.\n    *   `clear()`: Clear the canvas.\n    *   `drawShapes(shapes, baseX, baseY, scale)`: Draw an array of shape objects at a specific screen position and scale.\n    *   Implementations for Canvas 2D, WebGL, SVG can be developed. Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Hm, I think we'll want more shapes here, as well as the ability to support anchored shape rotation (which will make animation easier). Wouldn't hurt to give shapes an `id` as well for stuff like keyframing. I'm thinking we'll want ovals/ellipses, and maybe even things like clipping shapes (e.g. to use a half-circle for a character's foot). On the other hand, we could omit `rect` since we have `polygon`.\n\n    Importantly, this is going to need to be a little rendering language which looks reasonably-fluent to LLMs: They'll need to be able to work out where eyes go, where noses go, and so on. Starting with something simple and easy-to-render makes sense, but we'll want to push back and design a more LLM-oriented interface to produce that easy-to-render format at some point.\n}\n\n## 6. Music Integration (ABC Notation) 🎶\n\n*   **Format**: ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist. Example:\n    ```abc\n    X: 1\n    T: Spooky Theme\n    M: 4/4\n    L: 1/8\n    K: Am\n    \"Am\"A2 E2 G2 E2 | \"G\"B2 G2 d2 G2 | \"Am\"c4 B4 | A8 |]\n    ```\n*   **Rendering**: Use Node.js libraries to orchestrate:\n    1.  `abcjs`: Parse ABC to MIDI data structure or potentially directly to WAV (if library supports it).\n    2.  MIDI-to-Audio Renderer: Use a tool like `timidity++` (via child process or Node wrapper) with a suitable SoundFont (e.g., `FluidR3_GM`) to convert MIDI data/files to MP3/OGG/WAV.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Superb! One note: Let's assume that music starts off as Markdown files which contain a `score` directive like:\n\n    /score(sheet:something.abc,audio:something.mp3) {\n        A haunting song titled Uncanny Melody, played on the cello.\n    }\n\n    These live in separate Markdown files so they can be reused like Characters.\n}\n\n## 7. TTS Integration 🗣️\n\n*   **Workflow**:\n    1.  Parser identifies `dialog` directive.\n    2.  Extracts emoji for animation cues, cleans text for TTS.\n    3.  Checks if `voice` file exists in `--audio-cache`.\n    4.  If not found or `--force-regenerate`:\n        *   Retrieve `ttsVoiceSettings` from character module.\n        *   Call configured TTS API (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly via SDKs) with cleaned text and settings.\n        *   Save returned audio to the specified `voice` path.\n*   **Configuration**: TTS provider credentials and API choice configured globally for the build tool (e.g., via environment variables or a config file).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    nit: Let's call this Voice or Voiceover integration instead of TTS.\n\n    Instead of using an audio cache, I think we should have an `audio` attribute on `dialog` directives. In the future, maybe we can add some smart defaults when this is absent, but let's just require it for now.\n}\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Parse CLI arguments, identify input/output paths, libraries.\n2.  **Episode Parsing**: Read the main `.md` file. Parse directives sequentially.\n3.  **Asset Resolution & Generation (Iterative)**:\n    *   For `characters` directive: Load specified JS modules. Validate exports.\n    *   For `dialog` directive: Check/generate TTS audio, cache path. Store text, character, audio path, and extracted emoji cues.\n    *   For `music` directive: Check/generate ABC notation (via LLM if needed), check/render audio, cache paths. Store action and audio path.\n    *   Store other directives (setting, actions) in an ordered event list.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Generate JavaScript code for the embedded player:\n    *   Include character data (or references).\n    *   Include the ordered event list (actions, dialog cues + audio paths, music cues + audio paths, setting changes).\n    *   Include animation logic (how to interpret events and update state).\n    *   Include the chosen rendering module code (e.g., Canvas 2D renderer).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Create the final `.html` file:\n    *   Basic HTML structure.\n    *   CSS for styling (player UI, subtitles).\n    *   Embedded player JS (generated in step 4).\n    *   Necessary runtime libraries (e.g., `howler.js` for audio management if needed).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Great overview, really helped clarify the complexity. (Note that this may need updating to reflect revisions elsewhere based on other comments)\n}\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   A single HTML file.\n*   `<style>` block for CSS.\n*   `<canvas>` (or other) element for rendering.\n*   `<script>` block containing:\n    *   The renderer implementation (Canvas/WebGL/SVG).\n    *   The core player logic (event loop, state management).\n    *   The episode-specific data (event list, character info, audio paths).\n    *   Minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   **Markdown Parser**: `marked` or `markdown-it` with plugin support for custom directives.\n*   **Music Rendering**: `abcjs` (for ABC->MIDI/intermediate format), Node wrapper around `timidity++` or similar synth + SoundFont for MIDI->Audio.\n*   **TTS**: Node SDKs for cloud providers (Google TTS, AWS Polly).\n*   **Audio Playback (Runtime)**: HTML5 `<audio>` or a library like `howler.js` for better control.\n*   **Renderer (Runtime)**: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent. \n}\n\n} read⚡️\n🪄✨ read(project:povgoblin,file:README.md) {\n# POVgoblin 🧙‍♂️🖥️\n\nAn AI-powered POV-Ray scene generation assistant that leverages computational creativity to craft unique 3D scenes.\n\n## Installation 🚀\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g povgoblin\n```\n\nRequires POV-Ray (https://www.povray.org/download/)\n\n## Overview 🌟\n\nPOVgoblin generates and renders 3D scenes using POV-Ray, combining AI-driven creativity with precise computational rendering.

It allows you to define a set of commands that can be seamlessly embedded and executed within text-based documents. This can be particularly useful for building more powerful chatbots and text processing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\n## Usage 🪄\n\nTo use Necronomicon, you'll need to create a new `necronomicon` instance and provide your custom commands and symbol configuration:\n\n```javascript\nimport necronomicon from 'necronomicon';\n\nconst options = {\n  commands: [\n    // Define your commands here\n  ],\n  symbols: {\n    // Configure your directive syntax here\n  },\n  includes: {\n    results: true, // Include results of executing directives\n    text: true, // Include plain-text blocks\n    directives: true, // Include directive syntax around command output\n    promises: true // Include Promise-handling for asynchronous commands\n  }\n};\n\nconst necro = necronomicon(options);\n```\n\nThe `necronomicon` function returns an object with two methods:\n\n1. `document()`: This method generates documentation for the available commands in the Necronomicon.\n2. `execute(text)`: This method takes a string of text containing directives and executes them using the provided commands.\n\n### `commands` 🧠\n\nEach command in the Necronomicon is defined as an object with the following properties:\n\n- `name`: The name of the command (e.g., `'summonDemon'`, `'curseTarget'`).\n- `validate(attributes, body)`: A function that validates the command's attributes and body.\n- `execute(attributes, body)`: A function that executes the command with the provided attributes and body and returns the result.\n- `example`: An object with `attributes` and `body` properties, demonstrating how to use the command.\n- `description`: A description of what the command does.\n\nYou can add as many commands as you'd like to the Necronomicon, and they will be available for use in your directives.\n\n### `symbols` 🪄\n\nThe available symbol configuration options are:\n\n- `directive.start` and `directive.end`: The symbols that mark the start and end of a directive.\n- `attributes.start`, `attributes.separator`, `pair.separator`, and `attributes.end`: The symbols used for directive arguments.\n- `body.start` and `body.end`: The symbols that mark the start and end of the directive body.\n\nHere's an example of how to use custom symbols:\n\n```javascript\nconst options = {\n  symbols: {\n    directive: { start: '🪄✨ ', end: '⚡️' },\n    arguments: { start: '✨🌟⭐️', separator: '✨💫✨', end: '⭐️🌟✨' },\n    pair: { separator: ' 🔮 ' },\n    body: { start: '✨📜', end: '📜✨' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAn example directive using these symbols would look like:\n\n```\n🪄✨ summonDemon(name 🔮 Belial, power 🔮 666) ✨📜\nArise, Belial, demon of the abyss!\n📜✨ summonDemon⚡️\n```\n\n### `includes` 🔍\n\nThe `includes` option in the `necronomicon` options allows you to control what is included in the output when executing directives:\n\n- `results`: When `true`, the results of executing directives will be included in the output.\n- `text`: When `true`, any plain text blocks between directives will be included in the output.\n- `directives`: When `true`, the command output will be wrapped in the directive syntax. When `false`, the plain output will be returned.\n- `promises`: When `true`, the command output will be wrapped in a `Promise`, and individual commands will be awaited serially.\n\n## Contribution 🦄\n\nIf you have discovered new commands or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/necronomicon).

It is primarily intended to be used to provide custom behaviors to LLM assistants, but may be generally useful for parsing and rendering documents including directives in that form.\n\n## Syntax 🕸️\n\nThe Smarkup syntax uses directives, which are defined using the following format:\n\n**Directive with no arguments and no body**:\n```\n/directiveName()\n```\n\n**Directive with arguments and no body**:\n```\n/directiveName(attr1:value1, attr2:value2)\n```\n\n**Directive with arguments and a body**:\n```\n/directiveName(attr1:value1, attr2:value2) {\nThis is the content of the directive body.\n} directiveName!\n```\n\nThe directive starts with a forward slash (`/`) to mark the beginning, followed by the directive name. If the directive has attributes, they are enclosed in parentheses `()` and separated by commas. The key-value pairs for the attributes are separated by a colon (`:`).\n\nIf the directive has a body, it is enclosed between curly braces `{}`, and the directive name is repeated at the end, followed by an exclamation mark (`!`) to mark the end of the directive.\n\n## Usage 🕹️\n\nTo use Smarkup, you can use the `smarkup` function to parse and render the markup:\n\n```javascript\nimport smarkup from 'smarkup';\n\n// Parse smarkup input\nconst input = `/createProject(name:test)\nWe've created a project! Now, let's write an example file...\n/writeProjectFile(project:smarkup,file:example.txt) {\nThis is the content.\n} writeProjectFile!`;\n\nconst directives = smarkup().parse(input);\nconsole.log(directives);\n// Output:\n// [\n//   { action: 'createProject', attributes: { name: 'test' }, body: undefined },\n//   {\n//     action: 'writeProjectFile',\n//     attributes: { project: 'smarkup', file: 'example.txt' },\n//     body: 'This is the content.'\n//   }\n// ]\n\n// Render directives back to smarkup\nconst output = smarkup().render(directives);\nconsole.log(output);\n// Output:\n// /createProject(name:test)\n// /writeProjectFile(project:smarkup, file:example.txt) {\n// This is the content.\n// } writeProjectFile!\n```\n\nThe `parse` method takes an input string of Smarkup and returns an array of directive objects, each with the following properties:\n\n- `action`: The name of the directive (e.g., `'createProject'`, `'writeProjectFile'`).\n- `attributes`: An object containing the key-value pairs of the directive arguments.\n- `body`: The content of the directive body, if any. This will be a string.\n\n## Options 🔧\n\nThe `smarkup` function accepts an optional `options` object, which allows you to customize the behavior and symbols used in the markup language.\n\n### Symbols\n\nThe `options` object should have a `symbols` property, which can contain the following keys:\n\n- `directive.start`: The symbol that marks the start of a directive.\n- `directive.end`: The symbol that marks the end of a directive.\n- `attributes.start`: The symbol that marks the start of the directive arguments.\n- `attributes.separator`: The symbol that separates individual arguments.\n- `pair.separator`: The symbol that separates the key and value within an argument.\n- `attributes.end`: The symbol that marks the end of the directive arguments.\n- `body.start`: The symbol that marks the start of the directive body.\n- `body.end`: The symbol that marks the end of the directive body.\n\nHere's an example of how to use custom symbols:\n\n```javascript\nconst instance = smarkup({\n  symbols: {\n    directive: {\n      start: '🪄✨ ',\n      end: '⚡️'\n    },\n    arguments: {\n      start: '✨🌟⭐️',\n      separator: '✨💫✨',\n      end: '⭐️🌟✨'\n    },\n    pair: {\n      separator: ' 🔮 '\n    },\n    body: {\n      start: '✨📜',\n      end: '📜✨'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Text\n\nIf you set the `text` option to `true` when creating the Smarkup instance, the `parse` method will include a `text` property in each parsed directive object, containing the original text of the directive, including the directive syntax and body (if present). Additionally, when `text` is `true`, the `parse` method will also return objects with just a `text` property to represent standalone text blocks that are not part of any directive.\n\n```javascript\nconst instance = smarkup({ text: true });\nconst directives = instance.parse(input);\nconsole.log(directives);\n// Output:\n// [\n//   { action: 'createProject', attributes: { name: 'test' }, body: undefined, text: '/createProject(name:test)' },\n//   { text: 'We've created a project! Now, let's write an example file...' },\n//   {\n//     action: 'writeProjectFile',\n//     attributes: { project: 'smarkup', file: 'example.txt' },\n//     body: 'This is the content.',\n//     text: '/writeProjectFile(project:smarkup,file:example.txt) {\\nThis is the content.\\n} writeProjectFile!'\n//   }\n// ]\n```\n\n## Limitations 🌀\n\n- The Smarkup parser does not currently support comments or other advanced features.\n- The parser is case-sensitive, so the directive names and argument keys must match exactly.\n- The parser does not perform any validation or error-checking on the input string. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the input is correctly formatted.\n\n## Contributing 🦄\n\nIf you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nGreat! Please take another pass at DESIGN.md based on my feedback. Note that `necronomicon` is likely what we'll use to execute directives we see in Markdown files, and `povgoblin` uses an approach for POV-Ray scene generation that I think we can follow for other microcontent generation in here (music, artwork, etc); basically, run an LLM in a programmatically-supervised loop until it reaches an exist condition (e.g. a file can be parsed/validated)"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Understood, Dr. Woe! 😈 Your feedback is illuminating, like a phantom passing through a logic gate! 👻 We shall integrate these refinements, simplify the invocation, lean harder into Markdown and reusable components, and clarify the generative workflows inspired by `povgoblin` and empowered by `necronomicon` and `smarkup`.\n\nHere is the revised `DESIGN.md`, infused with these new directives and spectral insights:\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:DESIGN.md) {\n# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Design Document ✍️📐 (Revision 2)\n\nThis document details the design of the Aniheim Rendering Engine, specifying the interfaces, formats, and workflow required to fulfill the `SPECIFICATION.md`. Our goal is a **build system**, orchestrated by Node.js and leveraging `necronomicon` to execute `smarkup` directives, that transforms LLM-friendly source files (primarily Markdown) into self-contained HTML animations.\n\n## 1. Architecture Overview\n\nThe engine operates as a command-line build tool (`node build.js <episode_file>`). It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, recursively processes directives that link to external Markdown files (characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js + Necronomicon)};\n    C[Character.md] --> B;\n    D[Music.md] --> B;\n    E[Background.md] --> B;\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .js)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; C; D; E;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation is simplified:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file (e.g., deleting `./audio/alice_line_1.mp3` triggers regeneration on the next build). Asset library paths are implicitly relative to the file containing the directive.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format for episodes, characters, music definitions, and backgrounds, enabling reusability and LLM familiarity. Directives follow the `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value) { body } directive!`.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\nContains the overall narrative flow and scene composition.\n\n*   **Top-Level:** May contain metadata directives (e.g., `/title(Episode 1: The Phantom Frege)`).\n*   **Scene Definition:** Episodes are composed of sequential `/scene` directives.\n    ```markdown\n    /scene(duration: 30, background: '../settings/a-public-park.md')\n\n    # Scene Content - directives are processed based on timing attributes\n\n    # Load Assets for this Scene\n    /character(id: Alice, source: '../characters/alice.md', initialPos: [-0.2, 0.1, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /character(id: Bob, source: '../characters/bob.md', initialPos: [0.75, 0.15, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /music(id: bgm, source: '../music/happy-day.md', action: 'play', start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n    # Animation & Dialog Timeline\n    /move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, endPos: [0.25, 0.1, 0.5])\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Walk in, look neutral\n    /dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3') { 👋 Hi Bob! 😊 How's it going? } # Wave, then smile. Audio generation triggered if file missing.\n    /animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) { 🤔 } # Bob turns head? (Pose)\n    /dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3') { Not bad, Alice! 🙂 How are you? }\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) { 😊 } # Keep smiling while Bob talks\n\n    # Stop Music at end of scene (optional)\n    /music(id: bgm, action: 'stop', start: 29)\n\n    /scene! # End of scene block (optional marker, parsing stops at next /scene or EOF)\n    ```\n*   **Scene Space:** Coordinates (`initialPos`, `endPos`, etc.) use a normalized system:\n    *   `x`: -1 (left edge) to +1 (right edge)\n    *   `y`: 0 (bottom edge) to 1 (top edge) - Maybe adjust based on aspect ratio? Let's start with 0-1.\n    *   `z`: 0 (closest to camera) to 1 (furthest). Default character plane might be 0.5.\n    *   *(Design Note: LLM interaction with numeric coords needs monitoring. Future: symbolic placement like `pos: near(Bob)`)*\n*   **Timing:** `start` and `duration` attributes (in seconds) control the timeline within a scene.\n\n### 3.2. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\nDefines a character's appearance, voice, and potentially default behaviors.\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: './alice_voice.json') {\n  A clear, friendly female voice, slightly synthesized or ethereal, mid-range pitch. Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb.\n} voice!\n\n/artwork(renderer: './alice_renderer.js') {\n  Render as layered 2D shapes. Key features: translucent blue circle head, simple rectangle body, glowing lines for circuits. Eyes are simple white ovals. Allow standard expressions (smile, frown, surprised). Default pose is floating slightly.\n} artwork!\n\n# Optional: Default pose/expression\n/default(pose: 'idle', expression: 'neutral')\n```\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from the H1 heading (`# Alice`).\n*   `/voice`: Specifies voice characteristics.\n    *   `settings`: Path to a JSON file containing specific TTS parameters (e.g., `{ \"provider\": \"google\", \"voiceId\": \"en-US-Wavenet-F\", \"pitch\": 0, \"effects\": [\"reverb_small\"] }`).\n    *   **Generation:** If `settings` file doesn't exist, the build tool uses the body description (via an LLM helper, like `povgoblin`) to generate the JSON content.\n*   `/artwork`: Specifies visual appearance.\n    *   `renderer`: Path to a JS module responsible for translating pose/expression requests into the standard shape array format (see Section 5).\n    *   **Generation:** If `renderer` file doesn't exist, an LLM helper *could* attempt to generate a basic renderer based on the body description, outputting simple shapes. (Complexity: High - maybe start with requiring this file manually).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`, `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n### 3.3. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable piece of music.\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light, upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: './happy_day.abc', audio: './happy_day.mp3') {\n  Tempo: 120bpm\n  Key: C Major\n  Instrumentation: Piano main melody, light strings accompaniment.\n  Mood: Cheerful, simple, slightly whimsical.\n  Structure: AABA, approx 30 seconds loopable.\n} score!\n```\n\n*   `/score`: Defines the music asset.\n    *   `sheet`: Path to the canonical music notation (ABC format preferred).\n    *   `audio`: Path to the rendered audio file (MP3/OGG).\n    *   **Generation:**\n        1.  If `sheet` is missing, use LLM + body description to generate ABC content into the `sheet` file.\n        2.  If `audio` is missing, render the `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> Audio) and save to the `audio` path.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n### 3.4. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable scene background using artwork directives.\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass, a tree, and a bench.\n\n/artwork(renderer: './park_renderer.js') {\n  Layered 2D shapes. Bottom layer: solid green rectangle (grass). Middle layer: brown rectangle trunk + green circle canopy (tree) on the left. Front layer: simple brown polygon bench on the right. Blue rectangle sky at top.\n} artwork!\n```\n\n*   `/artwork`: Similar to characters, defines the visual elements. Static backgrounds might use simpler renderers or directly embed shape data.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nPoses and expressions are primarily controlled via standard Unicode emoji within `/dialog` and `/animate` directive bodies.\n\n*   **Mapping:** A global configuration (e.g., `pose_map.json`) maps specific emoji to:\n    *   **Pose Keys:** e.g., `🚶‍♀️` -> `'walk'`, `🧍` -> `'idle'`, `👋` -> `'wave'`. These keys are passed to the character's artwork renderer.\n    *   **Expression Keys:** e.g., `🙂` -> `'neutral'`, `😀` -> `'happy'`, `😢` -> `'sad'`, `🤔` -> `'thinking'`. These keys are also passed to the renderer.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The parser extracts emoji sequences.\n    *   The runtime player applies the corresponding pose/expression change when the emoji is encountered in the timeline associated with the directive's duration.\n    *   Multiple emoji in a sequence imply a sequence of changes within the directive's duration. `/animate(duration: 2) { 🤔 V }` -> Thinking for 1s, Peace sign for 1s.\n*   **Extensibility:** Character artwork renderers can implement custom mappings or handle standard keys appropriately. The global map defines engine defaults.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format (Runtime):** Character/Background `/artwork` renderers (`.js` modules) must ultimately provide data as an array of shape objects when called by the player.\n    ```javascript\n    // Example output from alice_renderer.js for getArtworkData('idle', 'happy')\n    [\n      // Shapes sorted by Z-index by renderer? Or player? Player responsibility.\n      { id: 'body', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5,-25],[5,-25],[5,25],[-5,25]], color: '#A0A0A0AA', x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.5, rotation: 0 }, // Body - relative coords\n      { id: 'head', type: 'ellipse', color: '#0000FFAA', rx: 15, ry: 15, x: 0, y: 35, z: 0.51 }, // Head\n      { id: 'eyeL', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: -5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Left Eye (relative to head's center?) - Coordinate system needs refinement. Let's assume relative to character anchor for now.\n      { id: 'eyeR', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: 5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Right Eye\n      { id: 'mouth', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5, 30], [0, 32], [5, 30]], fill: 'none', stroke: '#FFFFFF', lineWidth: 1, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.52 } // Simple smile line\n      // Clipping shapes TBD. Rotation anchor implicit (shape's x,y)?\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   **Shapes:** `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`.\n    *   **Properties:** `id` (optional string), `type`, `color` (CSS format, includes alpha), `x`, `y`, `z` (relative position), `rotation` (degrees, optional), shape-specific props (`radius`, `rx`, `ry`, `points`), drawing style (`fill`, `stroke`, `lineWidth`, optional).\n*   **LLM Bridge:** The *body* of the `/artwork` directive provides the semantic description. The associated `renderer.js` file is the **crucial bridge**, responsible for interpreting this description (or specific pose/expression keys) and generating the above shape array. Simple renderers might ignore the description and just use pose keys. Complex ones might use the description to modify base shapes.\n*   **Runtime Renderer Interface:** The player uses a swappable rendering module (Canvas2D, WebGL, SVG) with an interface like:\n    *   `init(containerElement)`\n    *   `renderFrame(shapeArrays)`: Takes a list of shape arrays (one per character/background element) and draws them. Handles layering (z-index), positioning (baseX/Y from directives), and scaling.\n    *   Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   **Format:** ABC Notation (`.abc`).\n*   **Generation:** Uses LLM prompt (from `/score` body) if `.abc` file is missing.\n*   **Rendering:** Uses `abcjs` + `timidity++` (or similar SoundFont synth) triggered by the build process if the target `.mp3` is missing.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   **Trigger:** `/dialog` directive specifies an `audio` file path.\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1. Build checks if `audio` file exists.\n    2. If not:\n        *   Load character's `/voice` settings JSON (generate JSON via LLM from description if missing).\n        *   Clean dialog text (remove emoji).\n        *   Call configured voice service API (e.g., Google TTS) with text and settings.\n        *   Save output to the `audio` path.\n*   **Requires:** Pre-configured API keys/credentials for the chosen voice service.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Simplified) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Entry Point**: Use `smarkup` + `necronomicon` to parse `episode.md`.\n3.  **Directive Execution (Build Time)**: `necronomicon` executes directives:\n    *   `/scene`: Defines scope for timeline processing.\n    *   `/character`, `/music`, `/background`: Recursively parse linked `.md` files, caching definitions. Execute contained `/voice`, `/artwork`, `/score` directives to ensure assets (JSON settings, renderers, ABC, MP3) are generated *if missing*, potentially calling LLM helpers. Store paths to required assets.\n    *   `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)`: Collate these into a timed event list associated with the current scene. For `/dialog`, ensure the `audio` path is resolved (triggering generation if needed).

Our goal is a **build system**, orchestrated by Node.js and leveraging `necronomicon` to execute `smarkup` directives, that transforms LLM-friendly source files (primarily Markdown) into self-contained HTML animations.\n\n## 1. Architecture Overview\n\nThe engine operates as a command-line build tool (`node build.js <episode_file>`). It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, recursively processes directives that link to external Markdown files (characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js + Necronomicon)};\n    C[Character.md] --> B;\n    D[Music.md] --> B;\n    E[Background.md] --> B;\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .js)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; C; D; E;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation is simplified:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file (e.g., deleting `./audio/alice_line_1.mp3` triggers regeneration on the next build). Asset library paths are implicitly relative to the file containing the directive.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format for episodes, characters, music definitions, and backgrounds, enabling reusability and LLM familiarity. Directives follow the `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value) { body } directive!`.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\nContains the overall narrative flow and scene composition.\n\n*   **Top-Level:** May contain metadata directives (e.g., `/title(Episode 1: The Phantom Frege)`).\n*   **Scene Definition:** Episodes are composed of sequential `/scene` directives.\n    ```markdown\n    /scene(duration: 30, background: '../settings/a-public-park.md')\n\n    # Scene Content - directives are processed based on timing attributes\n\n    # Load Assets for this Scene\n    /character(id: Alice, source: '../characters/alice.md', initialPos: [-0.2, 0.1, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /character(id: Bob, source: '../characters/bob.md', initialPos: [0.75, 0.15, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /music(id: bgm, source: '../music/happy-day.md', action: 'play', start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n    # Animation & Dialog Timeline\n    /move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, endPos: [0.25, 0.1, 0.5])\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Walk in, look neutral\n    /dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3') { 👋 Hi Bob! 😊 How's it going? } # Wave, then smile. Audio generation triggered if file missing.\n    /animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) { 🤔 } # Bob turns head? (Pose)\n    /dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3') { Not bad, Alice! 🙂 How are you? }\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) { 😊 } # Keep smiling while Bob talks\n\n    # Stop Music at end of scene (optional)\n    /music(id: bgm, action: 'stop', start: 29)\n\n    /scene! # End of scene block (optional marker, parsing stops at next /scene or EOF)\n    ```\n*   **Scene Space:** Coordinates (`initialPos`, `endPos`, etc.) use a normalized system:\n    *   `x`: -1 (left edge) to +1 (right edge)\n    *   `y`: 0 (bottom edge) to 1 (top edge) - Maybe adjust based on aspect ratio? Let's start with 0-1.\n    *   `z`: 0 (closest to camera) to 1 (furthest). Default character plane might be 0.5.\n    *   *(Design Note: LLM interaction with numeric coords needs monitoring. Future: symbolic placement like `pos: near(Bob)`)*\n*   **Timing:** `start` and `duration` attributes (in seconds) control the timeline within a scene.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Great! Continually improving here. Note that attributes supported by Smarkup are still pretty janky; they can't contain commas or parentheses, for example, due to the weak parsing. To work around that:\n\n    * Split up arrays (no `initialPos` because of the commas in the value; `x`, `y`, and `z`)\n    * Prefer to lean on the semantics of Markup when convenient\n        * For example, we could infer the title from the top-level section name (so that we don't break when we try to give an episode a name with a comma in it)\n        * This also reduces the number of directives we need to invent\n    * Remove any quotes from examples; assume things like filenames are comma/paren-free\n\n    Additionally, I like `initialPose`, but it can be made redundant by just including some emoji at the start of a dialog body. Let's prune it.\n}\n\n### 3.2. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\nDefines a character's appearance, voice, and potentially default behaviors.\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: './alice_voice.json') {\n  A clear, friendly female voice, slightly synthesized or ethereal, mid-range pitch. Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb.\n} voice!\n\n/artwork(renderer: './alice_renderer.js') {\n  Render as layered 2D shapes. Key features: translucent blue circle head, simple rectangle body, glowing lines for circuits. Eyes are simple white ovals. Allow standard expressions (smile, frown, surprised). Default pose is floating slightly.\n} artwork!\n\n# Optional: Default pose/expression\n/default(pose: 'idle', expression: 'neutral')\n```\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    nit: \"Render as layered 2D shapes\" doesn't need to be specified, since we'll always be rendering that way.\n}\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from the H1 heading (`# Alice`).\n*   `/voice`: Specifies voice characteristics.\n    *   `settings`: Path to a JSON file containing specific TTS parameters (e.g., `{ \"provider\": \"google\", \"voiceId\": \"en-US-Wavenet-F\", \"pitch\": 0, \"effects\": [\"reverb_small\"] }`).\n    *   **Generation:** If `settings` file doesn't exist, the build tool uses the body description (via an LLM helper, like `povgoblin`) to generate the JSON content.\n*   `/artwork`: Specifies visual appearance.\n    *   `renderer`: Path to a JS module responsible for translating pose/expression requests into the standard shape array format (see Section 5).\n    *   **Generation:** If `renderer` file doesn't exist, an LLM helper *could* attempt to generate a basic renderer based on the body description, outputting simple shapes. (Complexity: High - maybe start with requiring this file manually).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`, `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n### 3.3. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable piece of music.\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light, upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: './happy_day.abc', audio: './happy_day.mp3') {\n  Tempo: 120bpm\n  Key: C Major\n  Instrumentation: Piano main melody, light strings accompaniment.\n  Mood: Cheerful, simple, slightly whimsical.\n  Structure: AABA, approx 30 seconds loopable.\n} score!\n```\n\n*   `/score`: Defines the music asset.\n    *   `sheet`: Path to the canonical music notation (ABC format preferred).\n    *   `audio`: Path to the rendered audio file (MP3/OGG).\n    *   **Generation:**\n        1.  If `sheet` is missing, use LLM + body description to generate ABC content into the `sheet` file.\n        2.  If `audio` is missing, render the `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> Audio) and save to the `audio` path.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n### 3.4. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable scene background using artwork directives.\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass, a tree, and a bench.\n\n/artwork(renderer: './park_renderer.js') {\n  Layered 2D shapes. Bottom layer: solid green rectangle (grass). Middle layer: brown rectangle trunk + green circle canopy (tree) on the left. Front layer: simple brown polygon bench on the right. Blue rectangle sky at top.\n} artwork!\n```\n\n*   `/artwork`: Similar to characters, defines the visual elements. Static backgrounds might use simpler renderers or directly embed shape data.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nPoses and expressions are primarily controlled via standard Unicode emoji within `/dialog` and `/animate` directive bodies.\n\n*   **Mapping:** A global configuration (e.g., `pose_map.json`) maps specific emoji to:\n    *   **Pose Keys:** e.g., `🚶‍♀️` -> `'walk'`, `🧍` -> `'idle'`, `👋` -> `'wave'`. These keys are passed to the character's artwork renderer.\n    *   **Expression Keys:** e.g., `🙂` -> `'neutral'`, `😀` -> `'happy'`, `😢` -> `'sad'`, `🤔` -> `'thinking'`. These keys are also passed to the renderer.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The parser extracts emoji sequences.\n    *   The runtime player applies the corresponding pose/expression change when the emoji is encountered in the timeline associated with the directive's duration.\n    *   Multiple emoji in a sequence imply a sequence of changes within the directive's duration. `/animate(duration: 2) { 🤔 V }` -> Thinking for 1s, Peace sign for 1s.\n*   **Extensibility:** Character artwork renderers can implement custom mappings or handle standard keys appropriately. The global map defines engine defaults.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's try to design our interface for representing individual poses and expressions here. Both will be sets of well-defined parameters for controlling the rendering of a character; poses will control the relative orientation of limbs, and expressions will control the relative size, position, and orientation of facial elements. Let's go ahead and document all of our parameters here, as well as the coordinate system we'll work with.\n}\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format (Runtime):** Character/Background `/artwork` renderers (`.js` modules) must ultimately provide data as an array of shape objects when called by the player.\n    ```javascript\n    // Example output from alice_renderer.js for getArtworkData('idle', 'happy')\n    [\n      // Shapes sorted by Z-index by renderer? Or player? Player responsibility.\n      { id: 'body', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5,-25],[5,-25],[5,25],[-5,25]], color: '#A0A0A0AA', x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.5, rotation: 0 }, // Body - relative coords\n      { id: 'head', type: 'ellipse', color: '#0000FFAA', rx: 15, ry: 15, x: 0, y: 35, z: 0.51 }, // Head\n      { id: 'eyeL', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: -5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Left Eye (relative to head's center?) - Coordinate system needs refinement. Let's assume relative to character anchor for now.\n      { id: 'eyeR', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: 5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Right Eye\n      { id: 'mouth', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5, 30], [0, 32], [5, 30]], fill: 'none', stroke: '#FFFFFF', lineWidth: 1, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.52 } // Simple smile line\n      // Clipping shapes TBD. Rotation anchor implicit (shape's x,y)?\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   **Shapes:** `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`.\n    *   **Properties:** `id` (optional string), `type`, `color` (CSS format, includes alpha), `x`, `y`, `z` (relative position), `rotation` (degrees, optional), shape-specific props (`radius`, `rx`, `ry`, `points`), drawing style (`fill`, `stroke`, `lineWidth`, optional).\n*   **LLM Bridge:** The *body* of the `/artwork` directive provides the semantic description. The associated `renderer.js` file is the **crucial bridge**, responsible for interpreting this description (or specific pose/expression keys) and generating the above shape array. Simple renderers might ignore the description and just use pose keys. Complex ones might use the description to modify base shapes.\n*   **Runtime Renderer Interface:** The player uses a swappable rendering module (Canvas2D, WebGL, SVG) with an interface like:\n    *   `init(containerElement)`\n    *   `renderFrame(shapeArrays)`: Takes a list of shape arrays (one per character/background element) and draws them. Handles layering (z-index), positioning (baseX/Y from directives), and scaling.\n    *   Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Looking at the output format, I'm realizing this looks a lot like a list of directives:\n\n    /polygon(id:body,color:#A0A0A0AA,...etc) {\n        [-5,-25],[5,-25],[5,25],[-5,25]\n    } polygon!\n\n    Given that we just want to change the position of these based on pose and expression, maybe we should instead gravitate toward microformats with some basic arithmetic support, e.g.:\n\n    /circle(id:foo,x:position.x+4,radius:0.2,rotation:pose.shoulder.left.rotation)\n\n    We should also define our coordinate space. Let's assume that 1.0 is equivalent to the height of the display in pixels.\n}\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   **Format:** ABC Notation (`.abc`).\n*   **Generation:** Uses LLM prompt (from `/score` body) if `.abc` file is missing.\n*   **Rendering:** Uses `abcjs` + `timidity++` (or similar SoundFont synth) triggered by the build process if the target `.mp3` is missing.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   **Trigger:** `/dialog` directive specifies an `audio` file path.\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1. Build checks if `audio` file exists.\n    2. If not:\n        *   Load character's `/voice` settings JSON (generate JSON via LLM from description if missing).\n        *   Clean dialog text (remove emoji).\n        *   Call configured voice service API (e.g., Google TTS) with text and settings.\n        *   Save output to the `audio` path.\n*   **Requires:** Pre-configured API keys/credentials for the chosen voice service.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Simplified) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Entry Point**: Use `smarkup` + `necronomicon` to parse `episode.md`.\n3.  **Directive Execution (Build Time)**: `necronomicon` executes directives:\n    *   `/scene`: Defines scope for timeline processing.\n    *   `/character`, `/music`, `/background`: Recursively parse linked `.md` files, caching definitions.

It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, recursively processes directives that link to external Markdown files (characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings, potentially artwork render functions) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js + Necronomicon)};\n    C[Character.md] --> B;\n    D[Music.md] --> B;\n    E[Background.md] --> B;\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .js)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; C; D; E;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation remains minimal:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file. Paths are relative.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format. Directives use `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value)`. Note `smarkup` limitation: attribute values cannot contain commas or parentheses.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Episode 1 The Phantom Frege\n\nThis is narrative text in Markdown.\n\n/scene(duration: 30, background: ../settings/a-public-park.md)\n\n    # Load Assets for this Scene (IDs must be unique within the scene)\n    /character(id: Alice, source: ../characters/alice.md, initialX: -0.2, initialY: 0.1, initialZ: 0.5)\n    /character(id: Bob, source: ../characters/bob.md, initialX: 0.75, initialY: 0.15, initialZ: 0.5)\n    /music(id: bgm, source: ../music/happy-day.md, action: play, start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n    # Animation & Dialog Timeline (start/duration in seconds)\n    /move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, endX: 0.25, endY: 0.1, endZ: 0.5)\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Walk in neutral. Initial pose/expression set here.\n    /dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3) { 👋 Hi Bob! 😊 Hows it going } # Wave then smile. Note: Text for TTS cannot contain markup/emoji.\n    /animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) { 🤔 } # Bob turns head? (Pose)\n    /dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3) { Not bad Alice 🙂 How are you }\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) { 😊 } # Keep smiling\n\n    /music(id: bgm, action: stop, start: 29)\n\n/scene! # Optional end marker\n\n# More scenes can follow...\n```\n\n*   **Title:** Inferred from the top-level H1 heading.\n*   **Coordinates:** `initialX`, `initialY`, `initialZ`, `endX`, `endY`, `endZ`. System defined in Section 5.\n*   **Initial Pose:** Not an attribute; set by the first emoji in the first `/animate` or `/dialog` for that character.\n\n### 3.2. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: ./alice_voice.json) {\n  A clear friendly female voice slightly synthesized or ethereal mid-range pitch Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb\n} voice!\n\n/artwork() {\n  # Body uses the Artwork Microformat (see Section 5)\n  # Defines shapes relative to the character anchor (position.x position.y)\n  # Can use pose.* and expression.* variables\n\n  /polygon(id: body, color: #A0A0A0AA, z: 0) {\n    [-0.05 -0.1] [0.05 -0.1] [0.05 0.1] [-0.05 0.1]\n  } polygon! # A simple rectangle body\n\n  /ellipse(id: head, color: #0000FFAA, x: 0, y: 0.15, rx: 0.05, ry: 0.05, z: 0.1)\n\n  # Eyes - positions adjusted by expression.eyeOffset.y perhaps?\n  /circle(id: eyeL, color: white, x: -0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyeOffsetY, radius: 0.01, z: 0.2)\n  /circle(id: eyeR, color: white, x: 0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyeOffsetY, radius: 0.01, z: 0.2)\n\n  # Mouth - shape points defined by expression.mouthShape\n  /polygon(id: mouth, points: expression.mouthShape, fill: none, stroke: white, lineWidth: 0.002, z: 0.2)\n\n} artwork!\n\n```\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from H1.\n*   `/voice`: Generates/references TTS settings JSON. Body is LLM prompt.\n*   `/artwork`: No attributes. Body contains the character's visual definition using the **Artwork Microformat** (Section 5). This defines the base shapes and how they react to `pose` and `expression` variables. No external JS renderer needed by default.\n\n### 3.3. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: ./happy_day.abc, audio: ./happy_day.mp3) {\n  Tempo 120bpm Key C-Major Instrument piano Mood cheerful simple loopable\n} score!\n```\n\n*   Generates/references ABC sheet and rendered audio. Body is LLM prompt.\n\n### 3.4. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass a tree and a bench.\n\n/artwork() {\n  # Static shapes defined using Artwork Microformat\n  /polygon(id: grass, color: #00A000, z: 1) { [-1 0] [1 0] [1 0.3] [-1 0.3] } polygon!\n  /polygon(id: sky, color: #87CEEB, z: 0.9) { [-1 0.3] [1 0.3] [1 1] [-1 1] } polygon!\n  # ... tree bench etc ...\n} artwork!\n```\n* Uses the same `/artwork` directive and microformat as characters, but typically without pose/expression variables.\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nEmoji in `/dialog` and `/animate` bodies map to named poses/expressions, which translate to parameter sets used by the `/artwork` microformat.\n\n*   **Mapping:**\n    1.  `emoji_map.json`: `{\"😀\": \"happy\", \"🚶‍♀️\": \"walk\", \"🤔\": \"thinking_pose\", ...}`\n    2.  `pose_definitions.json`: `{\"walk\": { \"leftLegAngle\": 45, \"rightLegAngle\": -45, ... }, \"idle\": { ... }}`\n    3.  `expression_definitions.json`: `{\"happy\": { \"mouthShape\": \"smile\", \"eyeOffsetY\": 0.005, ... }, \"neutral\": { ... }}`\n    *   *(These JSON files define the standard library. Characters could potentially override/extend)*\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   Parser extracts emoji -> Looks up name in `emoji_map.json`.\n    *   Runtime fetches parameter set from `pose/expression_definitions.json` based on name.\n    *   These parameters populate the `pose.*` and `expression.*` variables available in the `/artwork` microformat.\n*   **Parameter Examples (Conceptual - need refinement):**\n    *   **Pose:** `pose.torso.angle`, `pose.head.tilt`, `pose.leftArm.shoulder.angle`, `pose.leftArm.elbow.angle`, `pose.rightLeg.knee.angle`, etc. (Angles in degrees).\n    *   **Expression:** `expression.mouthShape` (key for predefined polygon points like `'smile'`, `'frown'`, `'o_shape'`), `expression.eyeShape` (key like `'normal'`, `'wide'`, `'squint'`), `expression.eyebrowLeft.angle`, `expression.eyebrowRight.angle`, `expression.eyeOffsetY`.\n*   **Timeline:** Changes occur linearly interpolated over the duration specified by the number of emoji vs the directive duration. `/animate(duration: 2) { 🤔 V }` -> Apply \"thinking_pose\" params over 1s, then \"peace_sign\" params over the next 1s.\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\nArtwork is defined **declaratively** within `/artwork` bodies using a `smarkup`-like microformat.\n\n*   **Coordinate System:**\n    *   Normalized units based on **viewport height**. `1.0` = viewport height in pixels.\n    *   `y`: `0.0` is bottom edge, `1.0` is top edge.\n    *   `x`: `0.0` is center. Range depends on aspect ratio (e.g., `-aspectRatio/2` to `+aspectRatio/2`).\n    *   `z`: `0.0` is closest, `1.0` is furthest. Used for layering.\n    *   Coordinates within shape directives (`/circle`, `/polygon`) are **relative** to the character's anchor point (`position.x`, `position.y`).\n*   **Artwork Microformat Directives:**\n    *   `/circle(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, radius: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr)`\n    *   `/ellipse(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, rx: expr, ry: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr)`\n    *   `/polygon(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr) { [x1 y1] [x2 y2] ... } polygon!` (Points are relative to shape's x,y)\n    *   *(Maybe `/image(id: string, src: path, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, width: expr, height: expr, ?rotation: expr)` ? Deferred.)*\n*   **Attribute Expressions (`expr`):** Allow simple arithmetic using:\n    *   Constants (e.g., `0.1`).\n    *   `position.x`, `position.y`, `position.z` (Character's current position).\n    *   `pose.<param>` (e.g., `pose.leftArm.shoulder.angle`).\n    *   `expression.<param>` (e.g., `expression.mouthShape`, `expression.eyeOffsetY`).\n    *   Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (evaluated at runtime).\n*   **Runtime Rendering:**\n    1.  Build process parses the `/artwork` microformat into a structured definition (list of shapes with expression-based attributes).\n    2.  Runtime player evaluates the attribute expressions for each shape based on the character's current `position`, `pose`, and `expression` state for the frame.\n    3.  The chosen rendering engine (Canvas2D, etc.) receives the fully calculated shape properties (positions, colors, rotations) for drawing.\n*   **Runtime Renderer Interface:**\n    *   `init(containerElement)`\n    *   `renderFrame(calculatedShapes)`: Takes list of objects, each with final `id`, `type`, `color`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `rotation`, `points`, `radius`, etc. after expression evaluation.\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   Unchanged: Uses LLM for ABC generation from `/score` body if needed, renders ABC to audio via `abcjs`/synth if needed.\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   Unchanged: Uses LLM for voice settings generation from `/voice` body if needed, calls TTS service if `/dialog` audio file is missing.\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Revised) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Entry Point**: Use `smarkup` + `necronomicon`.\n3.  **Directive Execution (Build Time)**:\n    *   `/scene`: Define scope.\n    *   `/character`, `/music`, `/background`: Recursively parse linked `.md`.\n        *   Execute contained `/voice`, `/score` to generate/validate assets (`.json`, `.abc`, `.mp3`) using LLM helpers if files are missing.\n        *   Parse contained `/artwork` microformat into a structured **shape definition list** for the character/background. Store this definition.\n    *   `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)`: Collate into timed event list. Resolve `/dialog[audio]` paths (trigger TTS gen if needed). Extract emoji cues.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Assemble data for runtime player:\n    *   Character/Background definitions (incl. parsed shape definitions).\n    *   Music definitions (path to audio).\n    *   Timed event list.\n    *   Pose/Expression definitions (from JSONs).\n    *   Emoji map (from JSON).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Bundle player runtime JS, renderer JS, CSS, and episode data.\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   Unchanged: Single file with CSS, canvas/container, bundled JS (player core, renderer, episode data), minimal UI.\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   Build: Node.js, `smarkup`, `necronomicon`.\n*   Music: ABC, `abcjs`, `timidity++`.\n*   Voice: Cloud TTS SDKs.\n*   LLM: `phantomaton-gemini` or similar.\n*   Audio (Runtime): `howler.js`.\n*   Renderer (Runtime): Canvas 2D via swappable module.\n*   **Expression Evaluation (Runtime):** A simple math expression parser library (e.g., `mathjs` subset or custom).\n\nThis iteration solidifies the artwork definition process using an embedded microformat, directly linking it to pose/expression parameters and simplifying the character definition.

Paths are relative.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format. Directives use `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value)`. Note `smarkup` limitation: attribute values cannot contain commas or parentheses.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Episode 1 The Phantom Frege\n\nThis is narrative text in Markdown.\n\n/scene(duration: 30, background: ../settings/a-public-park.md)\n\n    # Load Assets for this Scene (IDs must be unique within the scene)\n    /character(id: Alice, source: ../characters/alice.md, initialX: -0.2, initialY: 0.1, initialZ: 0.5)\n    /character(id: Bob, source: ../characters/bob.md, initialX: 0.75, initialY: 0.15, initialZ: 0.5)\n    /music(id: bgm, source: ../music/happy-day.md, action: play, start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n    # Animation & Dialog Timeline (start/duration in seconds)\n    /move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, endX: 0.25, endY: 0.1, endZ: 0.5)\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Walk in neutral.

We'll have to get away with using a single-line `/scene` to establish a new scene boundary.\n    \n    Also, it's a nit, but `x` `y` and `z` for coordinate names please. The \"initial\" and \"end\" aspects can be inferred from context and/or explained in documentation.\n}\n\n*   **Title:** Inferred from the top-level H1 heading.\n*   **Coordinates:** `initialX`, `initialY`, `initialZ`, `endX`, `endY`, `endZ`. System defined in Section 5.\n*   **Initial Pose:** Not an attribute; set by the first emoji in the first `/animate` or `/dialog` for that character.\n\n### 3.2. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: ./alice_voice.json) {\n  A clear friendly female voice slightly synthesized or ethereal mid-range pitch Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb\n} voice!\n\n/artwork() {\n  # Body uses the Artwork Microformat (see Section 5)\n  # Defines shapes relative to the character anchor (position.x position.y)\n  # Can use pose.* and expression.* variables\n\n  /polygon(id: body, color: #A0A0A0AA, z: 0) {\n    [-0.05 -0.1] [0.05 -0.1] [0.05 0.1] [-0.05 0.1]\n  } polygon! # A simple rectangle body\n\n  /ellipse(id: head, color: #0000FFAA, x: 0, y: 0.15, rx: 0.05, ry: 0.05, z: 0.1)\n\n  # Eyes - positions adjusted by expression.eyeOffset.y perhaps?\n  /circle(id: eyeL, color: white, x: -0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyeOffsetY, radius: 0.01, z: 0.2)\n  /circle(id: eyeR, color: white, x: 0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyeOffsetY, radius: 0.01, z: 0.2)\n\n  # Mouth - shape points defined by expression.mouthShape\n  /polygon(id: mouth, points: expression.mouthShape, fill: none, stroke: white, lineWidth: 0.002, z: 0.2)\n\n} artwork!\n\n```\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Again, nested directives are unsupported. We can simulate that by doing:\n\n    /artwork(file:artwork.md) {\n        A pig wearing lipstick.\n    } artwork!\n\n    ...and then having the \"nested\" directives interpreted within that file.\n\n    This is also a little convenient insofar as it minimizes the number of directives we need to introduce in any given context. We can also support LLM-driven-generation-as-needed pretty easily with this approach.\n\n    (You know, let's consider handling `/scene` the same way in the next update. A briefer scene summary should be sufficient to give a sense of the fully story of an episode; the contents can include specific dialog, but we can omit things like music at the episode-level, balancing completeness and conciseness a little better.)\n}\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from H1.\n*   `/voice`: Generates/references TTS settings JSON. Body is LLM prompt.\n*   `/artwork`: No attributes. Body contains the character's visual definition using the **Artwork Microformat** (Section 5). This defines the base shapes and how they react to `pose` and `expression` variables. No external JS renderer needed by default.\n\n### 3.3. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: ./happy_day.abc, audio: ./happy_day.mp3) {\n  Tempo 120bpm Key C-Major Instrument piano Mood cheerful simple loopable\n} score!\n```\n\n*   Generates/references ABC sheet and rendered audio. Body is LLM prompt.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    100% fabulous! I think this is a good section to refer back to for other content generation types. Music generation has a lot of complexity to it, but we've made it so simple here.\n}\n\n### 3.4. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass a tree and a bench.\n\n/artwork() {\n  # Static shapes defined using Artwork Microformat\n  /polygon(id: grass, color: #00A000, z: 1) { [-1 0] [1 0] [1 0.3] [-1 0.3] } polygon!\n  /polygon(id: sky, color: #87CEEB, z: 0.9) { [-1 0.3] [1 0.3] [1 1] [-1 1] } polygon!\n  # ... tree bench etc ...\n} artwork!\n```\n* Uses the same `/artwork` directive and microformat as characters, but typically without pose/expression variables.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Love it! Excellent use of microformats for the polygon points. One note is that bodies can't appear on the same line in Smarkup, so the example should be more like:\n\n    /polygon(id: grass, color: #00A000, z: 1) {\n        [-1 0] [1 0] [1 0.3] [-1 0.3]\n    } polygon!\n}\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nEmoji in `/dialog` and `/animate` bodies map to named poses/expressions, which translate to parameter sets used by the `/artwork` microformat.\n\n*   **Mapping:**\n    1.  `emoji_map.json`: `{\"😀\": \"happy\", \"🚶‍♀️\": \"walk\", \"🤔\": \"thinking_pose\", ...}`\n    2.  `pose_definitions.json`: `{\"walk\": { \"leftLegAngle\": 45, \"rightLegAngle\": -45, ... }, \"idle\": { ... }}`\n    3.  `expression_definitions.json`: `{\"happy\": { \"mouthShape\": \"smile\", \"eyeOffsetY\": 0.005, ... }, \"neutral\": { ... }}`\n    *   *(These JSON files define the standard library. Characters could potentially override/extend)*\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   Parser extracts emoji -> Looks up name in `emoji_map.json`.\n    *   Runtime fetches parameter set from `pose/expression_definitions.json` based on name.\n    *   These parameters populate the `pose.*` and `expression.*` variables available in the `/artwork` microformat.\n*   **Parameter Examples (Conceptual - need refinement):**\n    *   **Pose:** `pose.torso.angle`, `pose.head.tilt`, `pose.leftArm.shoulder.angle`, `pose.leftArm.elbow.angle`, `pose.rightLeg.knee.angle`, etc. (Angles in degrees).\n    *   **Expression:** `expression.mouthShape` (key for predefined polygon points like `'smile'`, `'frown'`, `'o_shape'`), `expression.eyeShape` (key like `'normal'`, `'wide'`, `'squint'`), `expression.eyebrowLeft.angle`, `expression.eyebrowRight.angle`, `expression.eyeOffsetY`.\n*   **Timeline:** Changes occur linearly interpolated over the duration specified by the number of emoji vs the directive duration. `/animate(duration: 2) { 🤔 V }` -> Apply \"thinking_pose\" params over 1s, then \"peace_sign\" params over the next 1s.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This is heading in the right direction. We want a fully-documented pose and expression system, though, like:\n\n    pose:\n        left:\n            ankle:\n                bend: -1...1 # -1 = all the way back, 0 = straight, 1 = all the way forward\n            calf:\n                twist: -1...1 # -1 = twisted max left, 1 = twisted max right\n            knee:\n                bend: 0...1  # 0 = straight, 0.5 = 90-degree bend, 1.0 = fully bent\n            thigh:\n                twist: -1...1 # -1 = twisted max left, 1 = twisted max right\n        right:\n            ...\n    expression:\n        left:\n            eyebrow:\n                elevation: 0...1 # Lifted brow\n                rotation: -1...1 # -1 rotated outward, 0 flat, 1 rotated inward\n                width: 0...1     # 0 = narrow, e.g. scrunched, 1 = full width\n            lip:\n                corner:\n                    elevation: -1...1  # -1 frown, 0 neutral, 1 smiling\n                    roundness: 0...1   # 0 = open-mouthed, 1 = smiling/frowning\n        right:\n            ...\n        mouth:\n            height: 0...1 # 0=closed, 1=wide open\n            width: 0...1 # 0=pursed lips, 1=wide smile/frown/etc\n        nose:\n            height: 0...1        # 0 = fully scrunched, 1 = regular\n\n    We'll want to strike a challenging balance between providing enough specificity to capture a wide range of poses, without overwhelming ourselves with too many parameters. The key things that matter in the example above:\n\n    * Single-word variable names are preferred; `foo.bar` instead of `fooBar` so that we can group `foo` things easily\n    * Use a simple numbering system that applies directly to the joint being controlled. We don't want to be thinking in angles all the time; we want to be thinking in terms of the way an arm is positioned as it waves.\n    * Avoid enums like `mouthShape`; let's minimize the amount of prior knowledge implementations will need to show up with.\n    * Document the semantics of each parameter in plain, physical terms. Make it easy for the LLM to understand the body and/or face it is positioning.\n\n    I'm realizing there is a fair amount of latent complexity in this space. Let's find a good, initial, minimal scope to work with here, then consider refactoring out into its own package later.\n}\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\nArtwork is defined **declaratively** within `/artwork` bodies using a `smarkup`-like microformat.\n\n*   **Coordinate System:**\n    *   Normalized units based on **viewport height**. `1.0` = viewport height in pixels.\n    *   `y`: `0.0` is bottom edge, `1.0` is top edge.\n    *   `x`: `0.0` is center. Range depends on aspect ratio (e.g., `-aspectRatio/2` to `+aspectRatio/2`).\n    *   `z`: `0.0` is closest, `1.0` is furthest. Used for layering.\n    *   Coordinates within shape directives (`/circle`, `/polygon`) are **relative** to the character's anchor point (`position.x`, `position.y`).\n*   **Artwork Microformat Directives:**\n    *   `/circle(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, radius: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr)`\n    *   `/ellipse(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, rx: expr, ry: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr)`\n    *   `/polygon(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, color: hex, ?rotation: expr, ?fill: hex|none, ?stroke: hex, ?lineWidth: expr) { [x1 y1] [x2 y2] ... } polygon!` (Points are relative to shape's x,y)\n    *   *(Maybe `/image(id: string, src: path, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, width: expr, height: expr, ?rotation: expr)` ? Deferred.)*\n*   **Attribute Expressions (`expr`):** Allow simple arithmetic using:\n    *   Constants (e.g., `0.1`).\n    *   `position.x`, `position.y`, `position.z` (Character's current position).\n    *   `pose.<param>` (e.g., `pose.leftArm.shoulder.angle`).\n    *   `expression.<param>` (e.g., `expression.mouthShape`, `expression.eyeOffsetY`).\n    *   Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (evaluated at runtime).\n*   **Runtime Rendering:**\n    1.  Build process parses the `/artwork` microformat into a structured definition (list of shapes with expression-based attributes).\n    2.  Runtime player evaluates the attribute expressions for each shape based on the character's current `position`, `pose`, and `expression` state for the frame.\n    3.  The chosen rendering engine (Canvas2D, etc.) receives the fully calculated shape properties (positions, colors, rotations) for drawing.\n*   **Runtime Renderer Interface:**\n    *   `init(containerElement)`\n    *   `renderFrame(calculatedShapes)`: Takes list of objects, each with final `id`, `type`, `color`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `rotation`, `points`, `radius`, etc. after expression evaluation.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Drop `/circle` (redundant to ellipse) and the  `fill`, `stroke`, and `lineWidth` attributes; we'll just draw solid shapes for now.\n\n    `rotation` should be required for consistency.\n\n    No need for the runtime renderer interface at this level, let's omit that for now.\n}\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   Unchanged: Uses LLM for ABC generation from `/score` body if needed, renders ABC to audio via `abcjs`/synth if needed.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Please restore content to this section. I understand that it's unchanged, but we've effectively deleted it by saying \"unchanged\"\n}\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   Unchanged: Uses LLM for voice settings generation from `/voice` body if needed, calls TTS service if `/dialog` audio file is missing.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Please restore content to this section (as above)\n}\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Revised) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Entry Point**: Use `smarkup` + `necronomicon`.\n3.  **Directive Execution (Build Time)**:\n    *   `/scene`: Define scope.\n    *   `/character`, `/music`, `/background`: Recursively parse linked `.md`.\n        *   Execute contained `/voice`, `/score` to generate/validate assets (`.json`, `.abc`, `.mp3`) using LLM helpers if files are missing.\n        *   Parse contained `/artwork` microformat into a structured **shape definition list** for the character/background. Store this definition.\n    *   `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)`: Collate into timed event list. Resolve `/dialog[audio]` paths (trigger TTS gen if needed). Extract emoji cues.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Assemble data for runtime player:\n    *   Character/Background definitions (incl. parsed shape definitions).\n    *   Music definitions (path to audio).\n    *   Timed event list.\n    *   Pose/Expression definitions (from JSONs).\n    *   Emoji map (from JSON).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Bundle player runtime JS, renderer JS, CSS, and episode data.\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   Unchanged: Single file with CSS, canvas/container, bundled JS (player core, renderer, episode data), minimal UI.\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   Build: Node.js, `smarkup`, `necronomicon`.\n*   Music: ABC, `abcjs`, `timidity++`.\n*   Voice: Cloud TTS SDKs.\n*   LLM: `phantomaton-gemini` or similar.\n*   Audio (Runtime): `howler.js`.\n*   Renderer (Runtime): Canvas 2D via swappable module.\n*   **Expression Evaluation (Runtime):** A simple math expression parser library (e.g., `mathjs` subset or custom).\n\n} read⚡️"

    "content": "Understood, Dr. Woe! Incorporating these final refinements. We'll flatten the directive structures by linking to external files, simplify coordinates, detail the initial pose/expression system, and trim the artwork directives. Let's materialize this final design! 👻✨\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:DESIGN.md) {\n# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Design Document ✍️📐 (Revision 4)\n\nThis document details the design of the Aniheim Rendering Engine, specifying the interfaces, formats, and workflow required to fulfill the `SPECIFICATION.md`. Our goal is a **build system**, orchestrated by Node.js and leveraging `necronomicon` to execute `smarkup` directives, that transforms LLM-friendly source files (primarily Markdown) into self-contained HTML animations.\n\n## 1. Architecture Overview\n\nThe engine operates as a command-line build tool (`node build.js <episode_file>`). It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, which primarily defines the sequence of scenes by linking to external Scene Markdown files. It recursively processes directives within these files (linking to characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings, artwork definitions) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine};\n    S[Scene.md] --> B; # Episode links to Scene\n    C[Character.md] --> B; # Scene links to Character\n    D[Music.md] --> B; # Scene links to Music\n    E[Background.md] --> B; # Scene links to Background\n    Art[Artwork.md] --> B; # Character/BG links to ArtworkDef\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .md)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; S; C; D; E; Art;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation remains minimal:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file. Paths are relative.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format. Directives use `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value)`. Attribute values cannot contain commas or parentheses. Files link to each other to manage complexity.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\nDefines the sequence of scenes.\n\n```markdown\n# Episode 1 The Phantom Frege\n\nThis episode introduces Alice and Bob.\n\n/scene(file: ./scene1_park_intro.md)\n/scene(file: ./scene2_frege_discussion.md)\n# ... more scenes\n```\n\n*   **Title:** Inferred from the top-level H1 heading.\n*   `/scene`: Marks the start of a new scene and points to the Markdown file containing its detailed definition.\n\n### 3.2. Scene Definition (`scene.md`)\n\nContains the detailed content of a single scene. Example: `scene1_park_intro.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Scene: Park Introduction (Duration ~15s)\n\n/background(file: ../settings/a-public-park.md)\n\n# Load Assets (IDs unique within scene)\n/character(id: Alice, source: ../characters/alice.md, x: -0.2, y: 0.1, z: 0.5)\n/character(id: Bob, source: ../characters/bob.md, x: 0.75, y: 0.15, z: 0.5)\n/music(id: bgm, source: ../music/happy-day.md, action: play, start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n# Animation & Dialog Timeline (start/duration in seconds)\n/move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, x: 0.25, y: 0.1, z: 0.5)\n/animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Initial pose/expression\n/dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3) { 👋 Hi Bob 😊 Hows it going }\n/animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) { 🤔 }\n/dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3) { Not bad Alice 🙂 How are you }\n/animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) { 😊 }\n/music(id: bgm, action: stop, start: 14)\n```\n\n*   Contains directives for background, characters, music, movement, animation, and dialog specific to this scene.\n*   **Initial Pose:** Set by the first emoji in the first `/animate` or `/dialog` for that character within the scene.\n\n### 3.3. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: ./alice_voice.json) {\n  A clear friendly female voice slightly synthesized or ethereal mid-range pitch Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb\n} voice!\n\n/artwork(file: ./alice_artwork.md) {\n  Key features translucent blue circle head simple rectangle body glowing lines for circuits Eyes are simple white ovals Allow standard expressions smile frown surprised Default pose is floating slightly\n} artwork!\n```\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from H1.\n*   `/voice`: Generates/references TTS settings JSON. Body is LLM prompt.\n*   `/artwork`: Points to an external file containing the artwork microformat definition. The body is an LLM prompt used to generate that file if it doesn't exist.\n\n### 3.4. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: ./happy_day.abc, audio: ./happy_day.mp3) {\n  Tempo 120bpm Key C-Major Instrument piano Mood cheerful simple loopable\n} score!\n```\n\n*   `/score`: Defines the music asset.\n    *   `sheet`: Path to the canonical music notation (ABC format preferred).\n    *   `audio`: Path to the rendered audio file (MP3/OGG).\n    *   **Generation:**\n        1.  If `sheet` is missing, use LLM + body description to generate ABC content into the `sheet` file.\n        2.  If `audio` is missing, render the `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> Audio) and save to the `audio` path.\n\n### 3.5. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass a tree and a bench.\n\n/artwork(file: ./park_artwork.md) {\n    Layered 2D shapes Bottom layer solid green rectangle grass Middle layer brown rectangle trunk plus green circle canopy tree on the left Front layer simple brown polygon bench on the right Blue rectangle sky at top\n} artwork!\n\n```\n* Uses `/artwork` directive pointing to an external file containing the artwork microformat definition. Body is LLM prompt for generation.\n\n### 3.6. Artwork Definition (`artwork.md`)\n\nContains the actual artwork microformat directives. Example: `park_artwork.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Static shapes defined using Artwork Microformat\n/polygon(id: grass, color: #00A000, rotation: 0, z: 1) {\n    [-1 0] [1 0] [1 0.3] [-1 0.3]\n} polygon!\n/polygon(id: sky, color: #87CEEB, rotation: 0, z: 0.9) {\n    [-1 0.3] [1 0.3] [1 1] [-1 1]\n} polygon!\n# ... tree bench etc ...\n```\nExample: `alice_artwork.md`\n```markdown\n# Body uses the Artwork Microformat (see Section 5)\n# Defines shapes relative to the character anchor (position.x position.y)\n# Can use pose.* and expression.* variables\n\n/polygon(id: body, color: #A0A0A0AA, rotation: pose.torso.angle, z: 0.5) {\n    [-0.05 -0.1] [0.05 -0.1] [0.05 0.1] [-0.05 0.1]\n} polygon! # A simple rectangle body\n\n/ellipse(id: head, color: #0000FFAA, x: 0, y: 0.15, rx: 0.05, ry: 0.05, rotation: pose.head.tilt, z: 0.6)\n\n# Eyes - positions adjusted by expression\n/ellipse(id: eyeL, color: white, x: -0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyes.offsetY, rx: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, ry: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, rotation: 0, z: 0.7)\n/ellipse(id: eyeR, color: white, x: 0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyes.offsetY, rx: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, ry: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, rotation: 0, z: 0.7)\n\n# Mouth - shape points potentially defined by expression parameters\n/polygon(id: mouth, pointsExpr: expression.mouth.shape, color: white, x: 0, y: 0.13, rotation: 0, z: 0.7) {\n    # Default points (neutral) if expression.mouth.shape is null/undefined? Or rely on expression defs.\n    [-0.03 0] [0.03 0]\n} polygon!\n```\n\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nEmoji map to named parameter sets applied to `pose.*` and `expression.*` variables in the artwork microformat.\n\n*   **Mapping Files:**\n    1.  `emoji_map.json`: `{\"😀\": \"happy\", \"🚶‍♀️\": \"walk\", \"🤔\": \"thinking_pose\", ...}`\n    2.  `pose_definitions.json`: Defines parameter sets for poses.\n    3.  `expression_definitions.json`: Defines parameter sets for expressions.\n*   **Parameter Definition (Initial Minimal Set):**\n    *   Uses `.` notation. Ranges are guides; exact interpretation depends on artwork definition.\n    *   **Pose Parameters:**\n        *   `pose.head.tilt`: (-1 right .. 0 center .. 1 left)\n        *   `pose.torso.bend`: (-1 back .. 0 straight .. 1 forward)\n        *   `pose.left.arm.lift`: (0 down .. 1 horizontal) - Shoulder lift\n        *   `pose.left.arm.bend`: (0 straight .. 1 fully bent) - Elbow bend\n        *   `pose.right.arm.lift`: (0 down .. 1 horizontal)\n        *   `pose.right.arm.bend`: (0 straight .. 1 fully bent)\n        *   *(Shoulder forward/back, leg movements deferred)*\n    *   **Expression Parameters:**\n        *   `expression.mouth.open`: (0 closed .. 1 wide open)\n        *   `expression.mouth.smile`: (-1 frown .. 0 neutral .. 1 wide smile) - Affects corner elevation/shape\n        *   `expression.eyes.open`: (0 closed .. 1 wide open) - Affects eye shape radius/height\n        *   `expression.eyebrows.lift`: (-1 furrowed down .. 0 neutral .. 1 raised high) - Affects eyebrow vertical position/rotation\n        *   `expression.eyes.offsetY`: (-1 down .. 0 neutral .. 1 up) - Vertical shift for eyes\n        *   `expression.mouth.shape`: (Optional: Key referencing point list for complex shapes, e.g., `'o_shape'`. Default: null)\n*   **Timeline:** Parameters are linearly interpolated between states defined by emoji sequences over the directive's duration.\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\nDefined declaratively in `artwork.md` files using `smarkup`-like directives.\n\n*   **Coordinate System:**\n    *   Normalized units based on **viewport height**. `1.0` = viewport height.\n    *   `y`: `0.0` bottom, `1.0` top.\n    *   `x`: `0.0` center. (`-aspectRatio/2` to `+aspectRatio/2`).\n    *   `z`: `0.0` closest, `1.0` furthest.\n    *   Shape directive coordinates (`x`, `y`) are **relative** to the character's anchor (`position.x`, `position.y`).\n*   **Artwork Microformat Directives:**\n    *   `/ellipse(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, rx: expr, ry: expr, color: hex, rotation: expr)`\n    *   `/polygon(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, color: hex, rotation: expr, ?pointsExpr: var) { [x1 y1] [x2 y2] ... } polygon!` (Body defines default points, relative to shape x,y. `pointsExpr` can override with variable from expression defs).\n*   **Attribute Expressions (`expr`):** Simple arithmetic: constants, `position.*`, `pose.*`, `expression.*`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Evaluated at runtime.\n*   **Runtime Rendering:** Player evaluates expressions based on current state, passes calculated shape properties (final coords, color, rotation, points) to the rendering engine (e.g., Canvas 2D).\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   **Format:** ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist.\n*   **Generation:** Uses LLM prompt (from `/score` body) if `.abc` file is missing.\n*   **Rendering:** Uses `abcjs` + `timidity++` (or similar SoundFont synth) triggered by the build process if the target `.mp3` is missing.\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   **Trigger:** `/dialog` directive specifies an `audio` file path.\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1. Build checks if `audio` file exists.\n    2. If not:\n        *   Load character's `/voice` settings JSON (generate JSON via LLM from description in `character.md` if missing).\n        *   Clean dialog text (remove emoji).\n        *   Call configured voice service API (e.g., Google TTS) with text and settings.\n        *   Save output to the `audio` path.\n*   **Requires:** Pre-configured API keys/credentials for the chosen voice service.\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Revised) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Episode**: Parse `episode.md` using `smarkup` + `necronomicon`. Execute `/scene` directives.\n3.  **Parse Scene**: For each scene file linked by `/scene`:\n    *   Parse the `scene.md` file.\n    *   Execute `/background`, `/character`, `/music` directives:\n        *   Recursively parse linked `background.md`, `character.md`, `music.md`.\n        *   Execute contained `/voice`, `/score`, `/artwork` directives.\n            *   `/voice`/`/score`: Generate/validate assets (`.json`, `.abc`, `.mp3`) using LLM if files missing.\n            *   `/artwork`: Generate/validate linked `artwork.md` file using LLM if missing. Parse the `artwork.md` microformat into a structured **shape definition list**. Store definition associated with character/background ID.\n    *   Collate `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)` into a timed event list for the scene. Resolve `/dialog[audio]` paths (trigger TTS gen if needed). Extract emoji cues.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Assemble data for runtime player:\n    *   Character/Background definitions (incl. parsed shape definitions).\n    *   Music definitions (path to audio).\n    *   Timed event lists for all scenes.\n    *   Pose/Expression definitions (from JSONs).\n    *   Emoji map (from JSON).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Bundle player runtime JS, renderer JS, CSS, and episode data.\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   Single HTML file with CSS, canvas/container, bundled JS (player core, renderer, episode data), minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   Build: Node.js, `smarkup`, `necronomicon`.\n*   Music: ABC, `abcjs`, `timidity++`.\n*   Voice: Cloud TTS SDKs.\n*   LLM: `phantomaton-gemini` or similar.\n*   Audio (Runtime): `howler.js`.\n*   Renderer (Runtime): Canvas 2D via swappable module.\n*   Expression Evaluation (Runtime): Simple math expression parser (e.g., `mathjs` subset or custom).\n\nThis design feels significantly more robust and addresses the `smarkup` constraints effectively, Dr. Woe. It relies heavily on linked Markdown files and clear interfaces for generated content. Is this phantom ready for implementation? 😈✅\n} write⚡️"

Our goal is a **build system**, orchestrated by Node.js and leveraging `necronomicon` to execute `smarkup` directives, that transforms LLM-friendly source files (primarily Markdown) into self-contained HTML animations.\n\n## 1. Architecture Overview\n\nThe engine operates as a command-line build tool (`node build.js <episode_file>`). It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, which primarily defines the sequence of scenes by linking to external Scene Markdown files. It recursively processes directives within these files (linking to characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings, artwork definitions) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine};\n    S[Scene.md] --> B; # Episode links to Scene\n    C[Character.md] --> B; # Scene links to Character\n    D[Music.md] --> B; # Scene links to Music\n    E[Background.md] --> B; # Scene links to Background\n    Art[Artwork.md] --> B; # Character/BG links to ArtworkDef\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .md)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; S; C; D; E; Art;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation remains minimal:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file. Paths are relative.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format. Directives use `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value)`. Attribute values cannot contain commas or parentheses. Files link to each other to manage complexity.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\nDefines the sequence of scenes.\n\n```markdown\n# Episode 1 The Phantom Frege\n\nThis episode introduces Alice and Bob.\n\n/scene(file: ./scene1_park_intro.md) {\n    Alice meets Bob in the park. We learn they share an interest in language theory.\n} scene!\n/scene(file: ./scene2_frege_discussion.md) {\n    Alice and Bob go to a coffee shop and discuss the work of Gottlob Frege.\n} scene!\n# ... more scenes\n```\n\n*   **Title:** Inferred from the top-level H1 heading.\n*   `/scene`: Marks the start of a new scene and points to the Markdown file containing its detailed definition. Contains a short summary of the scene to aid in continuity and generation.\n\n### 3.2. Scene Definition (`scene.md`)\n\nContains the detailed content of a single scene. Example: `scene1_park_intro.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Scene: Park Introduction (Duration ~15s)\n\n/background(file: ../settings/a-public-park.md)\n\n# Load Assets (IDs unique within scene)\n/character(id: Alice, source: ../characters/alice.md, x: -0.2, y: 0.1, z: 0.5)\n/character(id: Bob, source: ../characters/bob.md, x: 0.75, y: 0.15, z: 0.5)\n/music(id: bgm, source: ../music/happy-day.md, action: play, start: 0, duration: 15)\n\n# Animation & Dialog Timeline (start/duration in seconds)\n/move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, x: 0.25, y: 0.1, z: 0.5)\n/animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) {\n    🚶‍♀️🙂\n} animate!\n/dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3) {\n    👋 Hi, Bob! 😊 Hows it going?\n} dialog!\n/animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) {\n    🤔\n} animate!\n/dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: ./audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3) {\n    Not bad, Alice. 🙂 How are you?\n} dialog!\n/animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) {\n    😊\n}\n```\n\n*   Contains directives for background, characters, music, movement, animation, and dialog specific to this scene.\n*   **Initial Pose:** Set by the first emoji in the first `/animate` or `/dialog` for that character within the scene.\n\n### 3.3. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: ./alice_voice.json) {\n  A clear friendly female voice slightly synthesized or ethereal mid-range pitch Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb\n} voice!\n\n/artwork(file: ./alice_artwork.md) {\n  Key features translucent blue circle head simple rectangle body glowing lines for circuits Eyes are simple white ovals Allow standard expressions smile frown surprised Default pose is floating slightly\n} artwork!\n```\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from H1.\n*   `/voice`: Generates/references TTS settings JSON. Body is LLM prompt.\n*   `/artwork`: Points to an external file containing the artwork microformat definition. The body is an LLM prompt used to generate that file if it doesn't exist.\n\n### 3.4. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: ./happy_day.abc, audio: ./happy_day.mp3) {\n  Tempo 120bpm Key C-Major Instrument piano Mood cheerful simple loopable\n} score!\n```\n\n*   `/score`: Defines the music asset.\n    *   `sheet`: Path to the canonical music notation (ABC format preferred).\n    *   `audio`: Path to the rendered audio file (MP3/OGG).\n    *   **Generation:**\n        1.  If `sheet` is missing, use LLM + body description to generate ABC content into the `sheet` file.\n        2.  If `audio` is missing, render the `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> Audio) and save to the `audio` path.\n\n### 3.5. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass a tree and a bench.\n\n/artwork(file: ./park_artwork.md) {\n    Layered 2D shapes Bottom layer solid green rectangle grass Middle layer brown rectangle trunk plus green circle canopy tree on the left Front layer simple brown polygon bench on the right Blue rectangle sky at top\n} artwork!\n\n```\n* Uses `/artwork` directive pointing to an external file containing the artwork microformat definition. Body is LLM prompt for generation.\n\n### 3.6. Artwork Definition (`artwork.md`)\n\nContains the actual artwork microformat directives. Example: `park_artwork.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Static shapes defined using Artwork Microformat\n/polygon(id: grass, color: #00A000, rotation: 0, z: 1) {\n    [-1 0] [1 0] [1 0.3] [-1 0.3]\n} polygon!\n/polygon(id: sky, color: #87CEEB, rotation: 0, z: 0.9) {\n    [-1 0.3] [1 0.3] [1 1] [-1 1]\n} polygon!\n# ... tree bench etc ...\n```\nExample: `alice_artwork.md`\n```markdown\n# Body uses the Artwork Microformat (see Section 5)\n# Defines shapes relative to the character anchor (position.x position.y)\n# Can use pose.* and expression.* variables\n\n/polygon(id: body, color: #A0A0A0AA, rotation: pose.torso.angle, z: 0.5) {\n    [-0.05 -0.1] [0.05 -0.1] [0.05 0.1] [-0.05 0.1]\n} polygon! # A simple rectangle body\n\n/ellipse(id: head, color: #0000FFAA, x: 0, y: 0.15, rx: 0.05, ry: 0.05, rotation: pose.head.tilt, z: 0.6)\n\n# Eyes - positions adjusted by expression\n/ellipse(id: eyeL, color: white, x: -0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyes.offsetY, rx: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, ry: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, rotation: 0, z: 0.7)\n/ellipse(id: eyeR, color: white, x: 0.02, y: 0.17 + expression.eyes.offsetY, rx: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, ry: 0.01 * expression.eyes.open, rotation: 0, z: 0.7)\n\n# Mouth - shape points potentially defined by expression parameters\n/polygon(id: mouth, pointsExpr: expression.mouth.shape, color: white, x: 0, y: 0.13, rotation: 0, z: 0.7) {\n    # Default points (neutral) if expression.mouth.shape is null/undefined? Or rely on expression defs.\n    [-0.03 0] [0.03 0]\n} polygon!\n```\n\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nEmoji map to named parameter sets applied to `pose.*` and `expression.*` variables in the artwork microformat.\n\n*   **Mapping Files:**\n    1.  `emoji_map.json`: `{\"😀\": \"happy\", \"🚶‍♀️\": \"walk\", \"🤔\": \"thinking_pose\", ...}`\n    2.  `pose_definitions.json`: Defines parameter sets for poses.\n    3.  `expression_definitions.json`: Defines parameter sets for expressions.\n*   **Parameter Definition (Initial Minimal Set):**\n    *   Uses `.` notation. Ranges are guides; exact interpretation depends on artwork definition.\n    *   **Pose Parameters:**\n        *   `pose.head.tilt`: (-1 right .. 0 center .. 1 left)\n        *   `pose.torso.bend`: (-1 back .. 0 straight .. 1 forward)\n        *   `pose.left.arm.lift`: (0 down .. 1 horizontal) - Shoulder lift\n        *   `pose.left.arm.bend`: (0 straight .. 1 fully bent) - Elbow bend\n        *   `pose.right.arm.lift`: (0 down .. 1 horizontal)\n        *   `pose.right.arm.bend`: (0 straight .. 1 fully bent)\n        *   *(Shoulder forward/back, leg movements deferred)*\n    *   **Expression Parameters:**\n        *   `expression.mouth.open`: (0 closed .. 1 wide open)\n        *   `expression.mouth.smile`: (-1 frown .. 0 neutral .. 1 wide smile) - Affects corner elevation/shape\n        *   `expression.eyes.open`: (0 closed .. 1 wide open) - Affects eye shape radius/height\n        *   `expression.eyebrows.lift`: (-1 furrowed down .. 0 neutral .. 1 raised high) - Affects eyebrow vertical position/rotation\n        *   `expression.mouth.shape`: (Optional: Key referencing point list for complex shapes, e.g., `'o_shape'`. Default: null)\n*   **Timeline:** Parameters are linearly interpolated between states defined by emoji sequences over the directive's duration.\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\nDefined declaratively in `artwork.md` files using `smarkup`-like directives.\n\n*   **Coordinate System:**\n    *   Normalized units based on **viewport height**. `1.0` = viewport height.\n    *   `y`: `0.0` bottom, `1.0` top.\n    *   `x`: `0.0` center. (`-aspectRatio/2` to `+aspectRatio/2`).\n    *   `z`: `0.0` closest, `1.0` furthest.\n    *   Shape directive coordinates (`x`, `y`) are **relative** to the character's anchor (`position.x`, `position.y`).\n*   **Artwork Microformat Directives:**\n    *   `/ellipse(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, rx: expr, ry: expr, color: hex, rotation: expr)`\n    *   `/polygon(id: string, x: expr, y: expr, z: expr, color: hex, rotation: expr, ?pointsExpr: var) { [x1 y1] [x2 y2] ... } polygon!` (Body defines default points, relative to shape x,y. `pointsExpr` can override with variable from expression defs).\n*   **Attribute Expressions (`expr`):** Simple arithmetic: constants, `position.*`, `pose.*`, `expression.*`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Evaluated at runtime.\n*   **Runtime Rendering:** Player evaluates expressions based on current state, passes calculated shape properties (final coords, color, rotation, points) to the rendering engine (e.g., Canvas 2D).\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   **Format:** ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist.\n*   **Generation:** Uses LLM prompt (from `/score` body) if `.abc` file is missing.\n*   **Rendering:** Uses `abcjs` + `timidity++` (or similar SoundFont synth) triggered by the build process if the target `.mp3` is missing.\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   **Trigger:** `/dialog` directive specifies an `audio` file path.\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1. Build checks if `audio` file exists.\n    2. If not:\n        *   Load character's `/voice` settings JSON (generate JSON via LLM from description in `character.md` if missing).\n        *   Clean dialog text (remove emoji).\n        *   Call configured voice service API (e.g., Google TTS) with text and settings.\n        *   Save output to the `audio` path.\n*   **Requires:** Pre-configured API keys/credentials for the chosen voice service.\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Revised) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Episode**: Parse `episode.md` using `smarkup` + `necronomicon`. Execute `/scene` directives.\n3.  **Parse Scene**: For each scene file linked by `/scene`:\n    *   Parse the `scene.md` file.\n    *   Execute `/background`, `/character`, `/music` directives:\n        *   Recursively parse linked `background.md`, `character.md`, `music.md`.\n        *   Execute contained `/voice`, `/score`, `/artwork` directives.\n            *   `/voice`/`/score`: Generate/validate assets (`.json`, `.abc`, `.mp3`) using LLM if files missing.\n            *   `/artwork`: Generate/validate linked `artwork.md` file using LLM if missing. Parse the `artwork.md` microformat into a structured **shape definition list**. Store definition associated with character/background ID.\n    *   Collate `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)` into a timed event list for the scene. Resolve `/dialog[audio]` paths (trigger TTS gen if needed). Extract emoji cues.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Assemble data for runtime player:\n    *   Character/Background definitions (incl. parsed shape definitions).\n    *   Music definitions (path to audio).\n    *   Timed event lists for all scenes.\n    *   Pose/Expression definitions (from JSONs).\n    *   Emoji map (from JSON).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Bundle player runtime JS, renderer JS, CSS, and episode data.\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   Single HTML file with CSS, canvas/container, bundled JS (player core, renderer, episode data), minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   Build: Node.js, `smarkup`, `necronomicon`.\n*   Music: ABC, `abcjs`, `timidity++`.\n*   Voice: Cloud TTS SDKs.\n*   LLM: `phantomaton-gemini` or similar.\n*   Audio (Runtime): `howler.js`.\n*   Renderer (Runtime): Canvas 2D via swappable module.\n*   Expression Evaluation (Runtime): Simple math expression parser (e.g., `mathjs` subset or custom).\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nPerfect. Now, write `PLAN.md`. This should be a code plan: Every file, its imports, and their interfaces. Keep things simple. Prefer single-word names for vvariables, classes, etc wherever possible. Each file should export a function or class; document arguments, return values, and methods sufficient to support implementation and testing, and explain purpose well enough to validate the decisions. We'd like the full `DESIGN.md` to be accounted for in this plan."

Reads the entry point episode file and recursively processes linked files via commands. Collects all necessary data for the final HTML emission.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `necronomicon`, `./commands/index.js`, `./emit.js`\n*   **Exports:** `async function process(episodePath, outputPath)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `process(episodePath, outputPath)`:\n        *   Initializes `necronomicon` with commands from `./commands/index.js`.\n        *   Reads `episodePath` content.\n        *   Executes the content using `necronomicon.execute()`. The execution context/state will be built up by the command implementations (e.g., storing scene data, character defs).\n        *   After processing, calls `emit(outputPath, buildState)` with the final collected state.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/commands/index.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Aggregates and exports the list of command definitions for Necronomicon.\n*   **Imports:** `./scene.js`, `./character.js`, `./music.js`, `./background.js`, `./artwork.js`, `./score.js`, `./voice.js`, `./move.js`, `./animate.js`, `./dialog.js`\n*   **Exports:** `Array<CommandDefinition>` (Format expected by `necronomicon`)\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/commands/scene.js` (and other command files)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Defines a single command for Necronomicon (e.g., `/scene`). Handles attribute validation and execution logic during build time. Execution often involves reading linked files, triggering asset generation, or updating the build state.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `necronomicon` (potentially, if recursive processing needed), `../generate/*`, `../parse/*` (as needed).\n*   **Exports:** `CommandDefinition` object { name, description, validate, execute, example }.\n*   **Interface (`execute` function):**\n    *   `async execute(attributes, body, context)`:\n        *   `attributes`: Object of directive attributes.\n        *   `body`: String content of directive body (if any).\n        *   `context`: Shared build state object (passed by `necronomicon`). Allows commands to read/write data like parsed definitions, event lists, etc.\n        *   **Logic:** Validates attributes. Reads linked files (`attributes.file`, `attributes.source`). Calls generation functions (e.g., `generate.voice()`) if target assets (`attributes.audio`, `attributes.settings`) don't exist, passing LLM prompts from `body`. Parses content (e.g., `parse.artwork()`). Updates the `context` object with parsed data or adds events to a timeline. May recursively call `necronomicon.execute()` on linked file content.\n        *   **Returns:** (Typically `undefined` or status message). Result inclusion controlled by Necronomicon options.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/llm.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Abstract interaction with the configured LLM service (e.g., Gemini via `phantomaton-gemini`). Handles prompt formatting, API calls, and potentially retries/validation loops (a la `povgoblin`).\n*   **Imports:** `phantomaton-gemini` (or other LLM lib), configuration loader.\n*   **Exports:** `async function generate(prompt, validationFn?)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `generate(prompt, validationFn?)`: Sends `prompt` to LLM. If `validationFn` provided, retries until `validationFn(result)` returns true or max attempts reached.\n    *   **Returns:** `Promise<string>` (Generated text content).\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/voice.js`, `settings.js`, `score.js`, `music.js`, `artwork.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Specific asset generation logic. Checks file existence, calls `generate.llm()` with appropriate prompts (from directive bodies), uses external tools (TTS API, `timidity++`), and saves results to target file paths specified in directive attributes.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `./llm.js`, SDKs (e.g., `@google-cloud/text-to-speech`), `child_process` (for `timidity++`), `abcjs`.\n*   **Exports:** Functions like `async ensureVoiceAudio(filePath, text, settingsPath)`, `async ensureVoiceSettings(filePath, prompt)`, `async ensureScoreSheet(filePath, prompt)`, `async ensureScoreAudio(filePath, sheetPath)`, `async ensureArtworkDef(filePath, prompt)`.\n*   **Interface:** Functions take target file paths and necessary inputs (text, prompts, source paths). They are idempotent (check existence first).

For example, the `/scene` command is only going to get executed in the context of an episode, so I'd put that somewhere like `episodes/commands/scenes`. In practice, I think we have a few different \"necronomicon wrappers\" in the sense that we have a few different file types (and associated directive sets) which we'll support.\n\n    Similarly, `config` is the wrong idea for poses/expressions. Those will be globally reused, but we'll want to iterate on them via LLM interactions in much the same way as everything else. Those should live under the `/src` hierarchy somewhere.\n\n    I do like the split between `build` and `runtime`, so let's retain that.\n}\n\n## File Details\n\n---\n\n### `build.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Handles CLI arguments, initializes the build process.\n*   **Imports:** `path`, `fs`, `yargs`, `./src/build/process.js`\n*   **Exports:** None (Executable script).\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   Parses CLI args (`<episode_markdown_file>`, `--output`).\n    *   Determines absolute input/output paths.\n    *   Calls `process(episodePath, outputPath)` to start the build.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/process.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Orchestrates the build using Necronomicon to process Markdown files. Reads the entry point episode file and recursively processes linked files via commands. Collects all necessary data for the final HTML emission.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `necronomicon`, `./commands/index.js`, `./emit.js`\n*   **Exports:** `async function process(episodePath, outputPath)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `process(episodePath, outputPath)`:\n        *   Initializes `necronomicon` with commands from `./commands/index.js`.\n        *   Reads `episodePath` content.\n        *   Executes the content using `necronomicon.execute()`. The execution context/state will be built up by the command implementations (e.g., storing scene data, character defs).\n        *   After processing, calls `emit(outputPath, buildState)` with the final collected state.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/commands/index.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Aggregates and exports the list of command definitions for Necronomicon.\n*   **Imports:** `./scene.js`, `./character.js`, `./music.js`, `./background.js`, `./artwork.js`, `./score.js`, `./voice.js`, `./move.js`, `./animate.js`, `./dialog.js`\n*   **Exports:** `Array<CommandDefinition>` (Format expected by `necronomicon`)\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/commands/scene.js` (and other command files)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Defines a single command for Necronomicon (e.g., `/scene`). Handles attribute validation and execution logic during build time. Execution often involves reading linked files, triggering asset generation, or updating the build state.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `necronomicon` (potentially, if recursive processing needed), `../generate/*`, `../parse/*` (as needed).\n*   **Exports:** `CommandDefinition` object { name, description, validate, execute, example }.\n*   **Interface (`execute` function):**\n    *   `async execute(attributes, body, context)`:\n        *   `attributes`: Object of directive attributes.\n        *   `body`: String content of directive body (if any).\n        *   `context`: Shared build state object (passed by `necronomicon`). Allows commands to read/write data like parsed definitions, event lists, etc.\n        *   **Logic:** Validates attributes. Reads linked files (`attributes.file`, `attributes.source`). Calls generation functions (e.g., `generate.voice()`) if target assets (`attributes.audio`, `attributes.settings`) don't exist, passing LLM prompts from `body`. Parses content (e.g., `parse.artwork()`). Updates the `context` object with parsed data or adds events to a timeline. May recursively call `necronomicon.execute()` on linked file content.\n        *   **Returns:** (Typically `undefined` or status message). Result inclusion controlled by Necronomicon options.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/llm.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Abstract interaction with the configured LLM service (e.g., Gemini via `phantomaton-gemini`). Handles prompt formatting, API calls, and potentially retries/validation loops (a la `povgoblin`).\n*   **Imports:** `phantomaton-gemini` (or other LLM lib), configuration loader.\n*   **Exports:** `async function generate(prompt, validationFn?)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `generate(prompt, validationFn?)`: Sends `prompt` to LLM. If `validationFn` provided, retries until `validationFn(result)` returns true or max attempts reached.\n    *   **Returns:** `Promise<string>` (Generated text content).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's just omit this for now. There are some cases in here where the `povgoblin` approach might be useful, but for the most part episodes will be LLM-generated from the beginning, so the LLM can fill in those blanks.\n}\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/voice.js`, `settings.js`, `score.js`, `music.js`, `artwork.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Specific asset generation logic. Checks file existence, calls `generate.llm()` with appropriate prompts (from directive bodies), uses external tools (TTS API, `timidity++`), and saves results to target file paths specified in directive attributes.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `./llm.js`, SDKs (e.g., `@google-cloud/text-to-speech`), `child_process` (for `timidity++`), `abcjs`.\n*   **Exports:** Functions like `async ensureVoiceAudio(filePath, text, settingsPath)`, `async ensureVoiceSettings(filePath, prompt)`, `async ensureScoreSheet(filePath, prompt)`, `async ensureScoreAudio(filePath, sheetPath)`, `async ensureArtworkDef(filePath, prompt)`.\n*   **Interface:** Functions take target file paths and necessary inputs (text, prompts, source paths). They are idempotent (check existence first). Return `Promise<void>`.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Similar to the above, I think we just need `voice.js` and `score.js` (to produce voice and music mp3's) at this point. Everything else is text-based, so we can rely on the LLM that generates episodes to generate those details.\n\n    That said, we should surface clear error messages with line numbers when any of these text-based assets are missing, so that the author LLM knows to fill those in reactively.\n}\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/parse/artwork.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Parses the artwork microformat directives within an `artwork.md` file into a structured list of shape definitions.\n*   **Imports:** `smarkup`.\n*   **Exports:** `function parse(artworkMdContent)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `parse(artworkMdContent)`: Uses `smarkup` to parse the content.\n    *   **Returns:** `Array<ShapeDefinition>` (e.g., `{ id: 'head', type: 'ellipse', attributes: { x: '0', y: '0.15', color: '#0000FFAA', ... } }`). Attribute values are kept as strings containing expressions.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This might need to live in something like `build/formats/artwork/parse.js` so that we can have `build/artwork/commands/ellipse.js` and `build/artwork/commands/polygon.js` and so on.\n\n    Also, let's fully-specify `ShapeDefinition`. In keeping with our single-word names, I'd call it a `Cutout` instead.\n\n    From an OOP perspective, it would be great if `parse(artworkMd)` returned an `Artwork` object. Then, `artwork.render(location, pose, expression)` could return `Array<Cutout>`. (This allows us to move expression evaluation to build-time.)\n}\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/emit.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Takes the final build state (collected definitions, event lists, config data) and generates the output HTML file, bundling necessary runtime JavaScript.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `esbuild` (or other bundler).\n*   **Exports:** `async function emit(outputPath, state)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `emit(outputPath, state)`:\n        *   Loads runtime JS source files (`src/runtime/*`).\n        *   Injects the episode-specific `state` data (JSON stringified) into `src/runtime/data.js` (or similar mechanism).\n        *   Bundles runtime JS into a single script using `esbuild`.\n        *   Creates HTML structure referencing the bundled script and necessary CSS.\n        *   Writes the final HTML to `outputPath`.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/index.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Entry point for the bundled JavaScript in the output HTML. Initializes the player.\n*   **Imports:** `./player.js`, `./render.js`, `./audio.js`, `./data.js` (holds injected state), `../config/*.json`.\n*   **Exports:** None.\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   Reads episode `data` (definitions, events).\n    *   Reads config JSONs (emoji map, pose/expression defs).\n    *   Initializes `render`, `audio`.\n    *   Creates and starts `player` instance, passing necessary data and modules.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/player.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Manages the main animation loop (using `requestAnimationFrame`), updates time, processes events from the timeline, manages overall playback state (play/pause).\n*   **Imports:** `./state.js`, `./audio.js`, `./render.js`.\n*   **Exports:** `class Player { constructor(config); play(); pause(); }`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `constructor({ events, characters, backgrounds, music, poseMap, exprMap, audio, render, state })`: Stores references.\n    *   `play()`: Starts the animation loop.\n    *   `pause()`: Stops the animation loop.\n    *   `update(time)`: (Called by loop) Checks `events` timeline, triggers actions (calls `state.move`, `state.animate`, `audio.play`, etc.) based on current `time`. Calls `state.update()` and `render.draw(state.getShapes())`.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/render.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Implements the Canvas 2D rendering logic. Draws shapes based on calculated properties.\n*   **Imports:** None.\n*   **Exports:** `class Renderer { constructor(canvas); draw(shapes); }`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `constructor(canvas)`: Gets 2D context.\n    *   `draw(shapes)`: Clears canvas. Iterates through `shapes` array (pre-sorted by Z? Or sort here?), draws each ellipse/polygon using calculated `x, y, color, rotation, points, rx, ry`. Applies transformations based on scene coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/audio.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Wrapper around `howler.js` to manage loading and playback of voice and music audio tracks.\n*   **Imports:** `howler`.\n*   **Exports:** `class AudioManager { load(id, path); play(id, ?volume); stop(id); }`\n*   **Interface:** Provides methods to load audio files (referenced by IDs used in directives) and control playback.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/evaluate.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Parses and evaluates the simple arithmetic expressions found in artwork attribute values.\n*   **Imports:** `mathjs` (or custom parser).\n*   **Exports:** `function evaluate(expression, context)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `evaluate(expression, context)`: Parses `expression` string. Uses variables from `context` (e.g., `context = { position: {...}, pose: {...}, expression: {...} }`).\n    *   **Returns:** `number` (Result of the expression).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's settle on using a custom parser here.\n\n    Also, does this really need to be evaluated at run-time? Can't we do all the math at build-time and then just let the player play it? See notes on an `Artwork` class above.\n}\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/state.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Manages the current state of all characters (position, current pose parameters, current expression parameters). Calculates interpolated values based on active `/move` and `/animate` directives. Provides the final shape definitions for rendering.\n*   **Imports:** `./evaluate.js`, `./interpolate.js`.\n*   **Exports:** `class StateManager { constructor(chars, backgrounds, poseDefs, exprDefs); move(...); animate(...); update(deltaTime); getShapes(); }`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `constructor(...)`: Stores initial character/background definitions and pose/expression parameter definitions.\n    *   `move(charId, start, duration, endPos)`: Records a movement action.\n    *   `animate(charId, start, duration, sequence)`: Records pose/expression changes.\n    *   `update(deltaTime)`: Updates current time.

Commands update the shared `buildState`.\n        *   Reports clear errors (with line numbers if possible via Necronomicon context) if required files (like `.abc`, `.json`, linked `.md`) are missing.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/<context>/commands/*.js` (e.g., `episode/commands/scene.js`, `scene/commands/character.js`, `artwork/commands/ellipse.js`)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Defines Necronomicon commands valid within a specific file context.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `../state.js`, `../../generate/*`, `../../<other_contexts>/process.js`, `../../artwork/parse.js`.\n*   **Exports:** `CommandDefinition` object { name, description, validate, execute, example }.\n*   **Interface (`execute`):**\n    *   `async execute(attributes, body, context)`:\n        *   `context`: Shared build state object (`instanceof BuildState`).\n        *   **Logic:** Validates attributes. Triggers recursive processing by calling `process()` for linked files (`attributes.file`, `attributes.source`). For commands defining assets (`/voice`, `/score`, `/artwork` linker), checks existence of target files (`attributes.settings`, `attributes.sheet`, `attributes.audio`, `attributes.file` for artwork). If *binary* target (`.mp3`) missing, calls appropriate `generate` function. If *text* target (`.json`, `.abc`, `artwork.md`) missing, throws informative error. For `/artwork` in `character.md`/`background.md`, it ensures the linked `artwork.md` is processed via `artwork.process()` which uses `artwork.parse()` and stores the resulting `Artwork` structure in the `buildState`. For `/ellipse`/`/polygon` within `artwork.md`, it adds a `ShapeTemplate` to the current artwork being parsed (held in `buildState`). Scene commands (`/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`) add events to the scene timeline in `buildState`.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/voice.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Generates voice MP3 using TTS if file is missing.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, TTS SDK, `../state.js` (to get settings path).\n*   **Exports:** `async function ensureAudio(dialogData, buildState)`\n*   **Interface:** Takes dialog info (text, target audio path, character ID) and `buildState`. Reads voice settings JSON from path stored in `buildState` for the character. Calls TTS API. Saves MP3. Throws if settings JSON missing.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/generate/music.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Generates music MP3 from ABC file if MP3 is missing.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `child_process` (for `timidity++`), `abcjs`.\n*   **Exports:** `async function ensureAudio(scoreData)`\n*   **Interface:** Takes score info (sheet path, target audio path). Checks sheet exists (throws if not). Runs ABC -> MIDI -> MP3 pipeline. Saves MP3.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/artwork/parse.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Parses `artwork.md` content into an `Artwork` structure.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `./process.js` (to run necronomicon with artwork commands).\n*   **Exports:** `async function parse(artworkMdPath)`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `parse(artworkMdPath)`: Reads the file. Creates a temporary state for the artwork parser. Calls `artwork.process(artworkMdPath, tempState)` which uses Necronomicon and `/ellipse`/`/polygon` commands to populate `tempState.shapes`.\n    *   **Returns:** `Promise<Artwork>` (containing the `shapes: Array<ShapeTemplate>`).\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/state.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Defines and holds the shared state accumulated during the build process.\n*   **Imports:** None.\n*   **Exports:** `class BuildState { constructor(); addScene(); addCharacterDef(); addBackgroundDef(); addMusicDef(); addEvent(); ... }`\n*   **Interface:** A class instance passed around as the `context` in `necronomicon.execute`. Contains methods to store parsed definitions (characters, backgrounds, music, artwork structures), scene timelines (lists of events like move, animate, dialog), etc.\n\n---\n\n### `src/build/emit.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Generates the final HTML output.\n*   **Imports:** `fs`, `path`, `esbuild`.\n*   **Exports:** `async function emit(outputPath, state)`\n*   **Interface:** Bundles `src/runtime` code. Injects `state` (JSON-stringified, containing definitions and event timelines) into `runtime/data.js`. Writes final HTML.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/index.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Runtime entry point.\n*   **Imports:** `./player.js`, `./render.js`, `./audio.js`, `./data.js`, `../data/*.json`.\n*   **Interface:** Reads injected `data`. Reads static JSONs. Initializes and starts the `Player`.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/player.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Main animation loop, event processing, state delegation.\n*   **Imports:** `./state.js`, `./audio.js`, `./render.js`, `./evaluate.js`.\n*   **Exports:** `class Player { constructor(config); play(); pause(); }`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `constructor({ events, characters, backgrounds, music, poseMap, exprMap, audio, render })`: Stores data. Instantiates `RuntimeState`.\n    *   `play()`/`pause()`: Control loop.\n    *   `update(time)`: (Loop callback) Updates `RuntimeState` based on events active at `time`. Gets current character states (position, pose params, expression params) from `RuntimeState`. For each visible character/background, gets its `Artwork` structure. Evaluates each `ShapeTemplate`'s attributes using `evaluate()` with the current state params to get final `Cutout` properties. Calls `render.draw()` with the list of `Cutout` objects. Manages audio playback via `audio` manager.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/render.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Canvas 2D drawing implementation.\n*   **Imports:** None.\n*   **Exports:** `class Renderer { constructor(canvas); draw(cutouts); }`\n*   **Interface:** `draw(cutouts)` takes an array of fully calculated `Cutout` objects and draws them. Handles Z-sorting.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/audio.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** `howler.js` wrapper.\n*   **Imports:** `howler`.\n*   **Exports:** `class AudioManager { load(id, path); play(id, ?volume); stop(id); }`\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/evaluate.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Evaluates arithmetic expressions from `ShapeTemplate` attributes at runtime.\n*   **Imports:** Custom lightweight parser/evaluator.\n*   **Exports:** `function evaluate(expression, context)`\n*   **Interface:** `evaluate(expression, context)` takes string expression and context object (`{ position: {...}, pose: {...}, expression: {...} }`), returns `number`.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/state.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Manages current interpolated state (position, pose params, expression params) for characters based on timeline events.\n*   **Imports:** `./interpolate.js`, `../data/*.json` (for definitions).\n*   **Exports:** `class RuntimeState { constructor(chars, backgrounds, poseDefs, exprDefs, emojiMap); update(time, activeEvents); getCurrentParams(id); }`\n*   **Interface:**\n    *   `constructor(...)`: Stores definitions. Initializes character states.\n    *   `update(time, activeEvents)`: Calculates current interpolated `position`, `pose` parameters, `expression` parameters for all characters based on `activeEvents` determined by `Player`.\n    *   `getCurrentParams(id)`: Returns the current `{ position: {...}, pose: {...}, expression: {...} }` object for the given character ID.\n\n---\n\n### `src/runtime/interpolate.js`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Linear interpolation.\n*   **Imports:** None.\n*   **Exports:** `function lerp(a, b, t)`\n\n---\n\nThis revised plan reflects the contextual command processing, simplifies generation, focuses artwork definition, and clarifies the runtime evaluation flow.

You can write characters to `content/characters` and background environments in `content/settings`. Let's try to get a readable description of an episode before we try to fully render it.\n\nIn terms of content, Aniheim (the show) is intended to be a family-appropriate cartoon set in an alternate Anaheim. We represent the city as a giant amusement park and the characters as various cartoon-style animals. The main characters are kids: A cat, a bee, and a snake. The main antagonist is a spider, but not a villain; more like a frustrating grandpa who teaches inscrutable lessons. Tone should be light, with stories being mostly about having emotions and how to process them. We also want to embrace a certain sense of cynicism and sarcasm, but in a kid-appropriate way (e.g. nihilistic attitudes toward the eating of vegetables).

Let's reconsider the characters first, though. The naming is a bit too on-the-nose (e.g. Buzz for the Bee). Can we instead go almost orthogonal instead? For example, Felix would be an on-the-nose name for a cat (it shares a lot of letters with feline) whereas Felix might be a more orthogonal name for a fish. Let's get inventive there. Additionally, we'll want more detail for each character:\n\n* A little bit of backstory. Obliquely, these characters should represent communism, capitalism, and socialism; or, the three structuring elements from Böhm-Jacopini; or, consistency/availability/partition tolerance. That symbolism should be made very oblique: For instance, a \"socialist\" character might have a city council member for a parent, whereas a \"communist\" character might come from a union family, etc. We'll want to abstract these themes out strongly: In particular, a recurring supertheme will be that each of these perspectives has interesting universality properties, and may seem self-sufficient on their own, but truly efficient universality comes from the union of all three.\n* Let's get some dialog samples for each character, illustrating unique personalities\n* Similarly, let's flesh out physical descriptions a little more, with focus on common attire. This should be cohesive with backstory, without seeming stereotypical, trite, or contrived (tough balance)\n\nFinally, please record additional files like `content/thematics.md` to help us retain some of our learning around how we'll build this show."

These aren't literal representations but tonal and behavioral archetypes.\n\n1.  **Sequence (Vector the Snake):** Represents linear, step-by-step processing, planning, and following a defined path. Values history, order, and predictable outcomes. Can be rigid but reliable. Associated with methodical documentation and historical perspective (Archivist family).\n2.  **Selection (Flicker the Cat):** Represents branching choices, reactivity, and conditional logic (if-then-else). Driven by impulse, curiosity, and immediate stimuli. Values novelty and options. Can be unpredictable but adaptable.

Driven by efficiency, detail, and established routines. Values correctness, standards, and predictability through repetition. Can be anxious about deviation but thorough. Associated with large-scale systems maintenance and logistics (Park maintenance guild/co-op family).\n\n## Supertheme: Strength in Unity (Universality)\n\nWhile each approach (Sequence, Selection, Iteration) can solve many problems and seems complete on its own (\"Turing complete\" in the analogy), true effectiveness and resilience in navigating the complexities of Aniheim (and emotions) comes from their **combination**. The characters often fail when relying solely on their dominant mode but succeed when their approaches complement each other. Vector lays the path, Flicker chooses the branch, Tempo optimizes the loop.\n\n## Antagonist as Catalyst (Nexus the Spider)\n\nNexus represents the complex, often inscrutable, system they inhabit (the \"real world\" or the park's interconnectedness). He doesn't embody one mode but rather highlights the limitations of each individual approach through riddles and obstacles that require integrated thinking. He's not evil, just a force demanding a more holistic view.\n\n## Tone\n\nLight, comedic, slightly sarcastic, and cynical (especially regarding mundane annoyances). Emotional exploration is central, framed by the characters' differing processing styles. Family-appropriate, but with layers for older viewers to appreciate the subtle structures. We avoid direct political analogies, using the abstract structures (Sequence, Selection, Iteration) as the primary symbolic layer, mapped *obliquely* onto family backgrounds.\n} write⚡️\n\n**2.

Exhibits traits associated with the autism spectrum, including intense focus on specialized interests (e.g., fractal geometry, crystal formation, slime mold algorithms), stimming behaviors (like tracing patterns), and finding complex social cues less intuitive than logical systems.\n\n**Backstory:** Corrado's family works at the Aniheim Center for Complex Systems & Biological Computation. They study natural algorithms, model ecosystem dynamics, and explore emergent behaviors. Corrado spends hours observing patterns in the park's simulated tide pools, coding iterative simulations, and perfecting crystal-growing experiments in his room.\n\n**Physical Description:** A slender green python with bright, curious eyes behind slightly thick-rimmed glasses. Moves smoothly, sometimes pausing to trace a pattern on a surface with his tail-tip.

Strong traits of attention deficit.\n\n**Backstory:** Ada's family are renowned stage designers and illusionists working for Aniheim's Grand Theatre of Wonders. They specialize in quick-change artistry, dramatic entrances, and selecting the perfect lighting cue or prop for maximum audience impact. Ada grew up amidst backstage chaos, impromptu rehearsals, and the constant pressure to select the most dazzling, attention-grabbing option.\n\n**Physical Description:** A honeybee with perpetually vibrating antennae, reflecting their busy mind. Often adorned with glitter or scraps of colorful fabric. Wears eclectic, theatrical clothing – perhaps a brightly coloured tunic over striped leggings, mismatched gloves, and shoes that light up (intermittently). Goggles are brightly coloured, often askew.

Understands the park's deep structure and logical loopholes.\n\n**Backstory:** Tarski's origins are lost to time, perhaps dating back to the park's conceptual blueprints or even the philosophical debates that inspired its design. They inhabit the meta-level, the commentary track, the space between the rules. Tarski doesn't *live* in the park so much as *haunt* its logical framework.\n\n**Physical Description:** True form is a wise, ancient-looking jumping spider, grey-brown and fuzzy, with many deep, knowing eyes. Default appearance (rarely seen) might involve simple, flowing, neutral-coloured robes. Most often appears disguised – as a hyper-logical park rules official citing contradictory regulations, a librarian pointing out missing pages in park history, a game master whose rules seem to change, a cartographer whose maps contain deliberate paradoxes. The disguise often subtly shifts or reveals aspects of their spider nature if observed closely.\n\n**Dialog Samples:**\n*   (As Rules Official) \"Regulation 4.B states all paths must be followed.

Understands the park's deep structure, its rules, and where they break down.

Observes from a foundational perspective, seeing the gaps in the park's logic.\n\n**Backstory:** Dio's origins are unknown, perhaps predating the park itself, existing in the conceptual space where the rules were formed and found wanting.

Strong traits of attention deficit.\n\n**Backstory:** Sasha's family are kinetic artists and mobile designers for Aniheim's numerous parades and interactive installations.

They excel at quickly selecting the most marketable angle or iconic representation. Andy grew up amidst silkscreens, photo booths, and the constant selection of the 'fifteen minutes of fame' moment.\n\n**Physical Description:** A honeybee with antennae that seem to vibrate with captured energy. Often has colourful ink smudges on their hands/paws. Wears bold, graphic clothing – think simple shapes, high-contrast colours, maybe a soup-can-print bandana or a pop-art inspired tunic.

Update Thematics Document:**\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:content/thematics.md) {\n# Aniheim Thematic Underpinnings (Revision 3)\n\n## Core Theme: Structures of Action & Thought\n\nThe show subtly explores different fundamental approaches to processing the world and making decisions, loosely inspired by the **Böhm-Jacopini structured program theorem**. Characters embody these as behavioural archetypes:\n\n1.  **Iteration (Corrado the Snake):** Represents loops, refinement, precision, and pattern recognition. Focuses on correctness through repetition and detail. Values consistency. Can get stuck optimizing. **Masculine**.\n2.  **Sequence (Emmy the Cat):** Represents linear, step-by-step processing, following instructions, and established procedure. Values order, causality, and the \"right\" way. Can be frustrated by deviation. **Feminine**.\n3.  **Selection (Andy the Bee):** Represents branching choices, reactivity, decisiveness, and selecting the 'best' or most impactful option. Driven by achieving goals or capturing moments via strategic/aesthetic choices. Values novelty, impact, and options. Can be distractible or overly bold. **Non-Binary**.\n\n## Supertheme: Strength in Unity (Universality)\n\nWhile each approach is powerful, true effectiveness comes from their combination. Corrado refines the details, Emmy knows the correct procedure, Andy makes the bold choice. Their individual approaches often fall short, but together they navigate challenges more robustly.\n\n## Antagonist as Catalyst (Dio the Spider)\n\nDio (gender-fluid) represents **Complexity, Systems, and the limits of any given structure (Completeness/Incompleteness)**. Their cryptic interventions highlight the flaws or paradoxes inherent in relying solely on Iteration, Sequence, or Selection, pushing the kids towards more integrated thinking. Dio isn't an enemy, but a reflection of the messy, interconnected reality of Aniheim that defies simple categorization.\n\n## Tone & Narrative Focus\n\n*   **Tone:** Light, comedic, family-appropriate, with underlying layers of gentle sarcasm and observational wit regarding daily life and emotions. Avoids overly saccharine resolutions.\n*   **Conflict:** Primarily internal or situational, arising from everyday challenges within the Aniheim park setting (e.g., navigating crowds, dealing with malfunctioning attractions, managing expectations, interpersonal friction based on differing approaches). Conflicts are low-stakes in the grand scheme.\n*   **Resolution:** Focuses on **emotional processing**. Stories are less about *solving* the external problem perfectly and more about how the characters *feel* about the situation and how they (learn to) manage those feelings, individually and as a group. The \"better together\" theme often manifests in them helping each other understand or cope with their emotional reactions, even if the external goal isn't fully met. Episodes often end on a reflective or slightly ambiguous note rather than a neat wrap-up.\n\n} write⚡️\n\n**3. Rewritten Episode 1 Script:**\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:content/seasons/s01/episodes/s01e01.md) {\n# Aniheim S01E01 The Fluffiest Logic Trap\n\n**Logline:** Emmy's precise plan for acquiring the legendary \"Mega-Fluff\" cotton candy is complicated by Andy's search for the perfect photo op, Corrado's analysis of cloud dynamics, and a cryptic encounter with Dio the spider, leading to shared disappointment and an unexpected lesson in perspective.\n\n**(Scene: Main Street Park - Midday)**\n\n**Setting:** A sunny spot in Main Street Park. Topiaries look unnervingly perfect. The animatronic flower clock looms cheerfully. Faint midway sounds drift in.\n\n**Characters:** EMMY (Sequence Cat), CORRADO (Iteration Snake), ANDY (Selection Bee)\n\n**(OPEN on Emmy meticulously consulting a small, laminated playbook titled \"Operation: Sugar Acquisition - Optimal Path\". Corrado is coiled nearby, observing cloud formations with intense focus through a handheld lens. Andy darts around, framing shots with their hands.)**\n\n**ANDY:** (Stopping suddenly, framing Emmy) Yes! Perfect! The determined athlete versus the indifferent universe! Iconic! Hold that pose, Em!\n\n**EMMY:** (Without looking up) Negative, Andy. Phase One: Synchronize chronometers. According to historical park data, peak \"Mega-Fluff\" cotton candy availability window opens in precisely seven minutes. Optimal transit time via Route 7-Bravo is four minutes. We are adhering to the sequence.\n\n**CORRADO:** (Still looking up) Fascinating. The altocumulus stratification exhibits classic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability wave patterns. Observe the iterative bifurcations along the shear boundary... it's textbo–\n\n**EMMY:** (Interrupting, crisply) Focus, Corrado! Phase Two: Proceed to objective. Single file, maintain pace.\n\n**ANDY:** (Ignoring Emmy, now framing Corrado) Ooh, but the *texture*! The contemplative scientist grappling with atmospheric chaos! So much more dynamic! Quick, look thoughtful!\n\n**CORRADO:** I *am* thinking. About vorticity calculations. The process requires concentration. Your request for performative thoughtfulness is inefficient.\n\n**EMMY:** (Taps playbook impatiently) Team! Adherence to procedure is paramount for mission success! Deviation risks suboptimal sugar levels. Move out!\n\n**(Emmy strides off purposefully, following an invisible line on the pavement. Andy flits after, still trying to frame shots. Corrado sighs, uncoils, and follows, occasionally pausing to observe sidewalk crack patterns.)**\n\n---\n\n**(Scene: Pathway near Midway Entrance - A few minutes later)**\n\n**Setting:** A slightly crowded path lined with whimsical, slightly peeling vendor stalls. The Midway Arch looms ahead.\n\n**Characters:** Emmy, Corrado, Andy. DIO (Completeness Spider) appears.\n\n**(Emmy leads, checking her internal timer. Andy darts ahead, photographing a peculiar arrangement of discarded popcorn.)**\n\n**ANDY:** Masterpiece! Found art! The banality of consumption! Needs a title...\n\n**EMMY:** Andy! Formation! We're approaching the critical decision point – the vendor cluster requires precise navigation sequence Zeta!\n\n**(Suddenly, DIO appears, seemingly polishing the Midway Arch with a tiny cloth. They are disguised simply today, perhaps just wearing a slightly-too-large park employee cap.)**\n\n**DIO:** (Calmly, without looking directly at them) Seeking the apex of spun sugar, are we? The map indicates its presence. The procedure dictates the path. Completeness seems assured, hmm?\n\n**EMMY:** (Stops, annoyed) Affirmative. We are executing Optimal Path 7-Bravo. Stand aside, please. You're obstructing the designated pedestrian flow zone.\n\n**DIO:** (Chuckles softly) Flow zones... designated. And yet, does the designation *guarantee* the flow? Does the label on the jar *contain* the pickles within? What if the jar... is empty?\n\n**CORRADO:** (Eyes narrow, analyzing Dio) Your statement presents a paradox concerning representation versus reality, referencing the container/contained relationship. Interesting. Is this a semantic logic puzzle, or an observation on potential system state failure? Request parameters.\n\n**ANDY:** (Framing Dio) Wow! The enigmatic questioner! The cosmic custodian! Love the hat! Is this irony? Performance art? Both? Hold still!\n\n**DIO:** (Turns slightly, fixing one large eye on Emmy) Your sequence is perfect, cat. Your iterations are precise, snake. Your selections are bold, bee. But can a *complete* plan account for... absence? Contemplate the fluffiness of nothing. *Vanishes with a barely perceptible *pop*, leaving behind only a slightly cleaner spot on the arch.*\n\n**EMMY:** (Stares at the spot, processing) ...Irrelevant data point. Sequence deviation minimal. Proceed to objective!\n\n**(Emmy marches on, slightly faster. Corrado looks thoughtful. Andy looks disappointed Dio didn't stay for more pictures.)**\n\n---\n\n**(Scene: Midway - Cotton Candy Stand - A moment later)**\n\n**Setting:** The colourful, slightly sticky-looking Mega-Fluff cotton candy stand. A large, cheerful sign hangs crookedly: \"CLOSED - Recalibrating Fluff Matrix.\"\n\n**Characters:** Emmy, Corrado, Andy.\n\n**(Emmy arrives, stops short, staring at the sign. Her athletic confidence visibly deflates.)**\n\n**EMMY:** Closed? But... the schedule! The optimal window! The sequence...! This outcome... was not in the playbook. (Her ears droop).\n\n**ANDY:** (Gasps dramatically) The void! The crushing weight of expectation unmet! The ultimate anti-climax! It's... it's *perfectly* disappointing! Quick, Emmy, look devastated! This is pure existential angst! Capture the moment!\n\n**(Andy tries to frame a shot of Emmy's slumped form. Emmy just stares numbly at the sign.)**\n\n**CORRADO:** (Examining the sign) Fascinating. \"Recalibrating Fluff Matrix.\" It implies an iterative process failure. Perhaps the fractal dimension of the sugar strands exceeded tolerance levels, requiring a parameter reset. Based on Dio's commentary, this state of 'absence' was a predictable potential outcome within the larger system, even if not explicitly included in your sequence, Emmy. The disappointment stems from assuming the plan's completeness.\n\n**EMMY:** (Muttering) But... the plan *was* complete... for the known variables...\n\n**ANDY:** (Lowering their hands) Okay, yeah, this is actually just... sad. Less 'artistic angst', more 'bummer'. (Nudges Emmy gently) Hey, it's okay. We selected the best path based on available data! Sometimes the data lies! Or... takes a break?\n\n**CORRADO:** Or perhaps the concept of 'best path' is contingent upon a system state that is inherently mutable. The disappointment is a valid data point regarding expectation management. We can iterate on this feeling. Observe its parameters. Duration? Intensity? Physiological correlates?\n\n**EMMY:** (Sighs, a deep, shuddering cat sigh) It just... feels bad. I followed the steps. It was supposed to work.\n\n**ANDY:** Yeah, bummer. Okay, new selection! Option A: Mope artistically. Option B: Find ironic beauty in the 'Closed' sign. Option C: Pretzel cart? I saw one looking suspiciously unsupervised back there... Selection C feels dynamically promising!\n\n**(Andy perks up, already scanning for the cart. Corrado starts analyzing the sign's font kerning. Emmy looks from the sign to her friends, a flicker of something other than disappointment in her eyes - maybe understanding, maybe just hunger.)**\n\n**EMMY:** (Slowly) Pretzel cart... Sequence for acquisition is simpler... Less prone to matrix recalibration... Okay. New objective. Let's go.\n\n**(Emmy straightens up, not quite back to full athletic form, but moving. Andy buzzes with excitement, leading the way. Corrado makes one last note about the sign's rust patterns before following.)**\n\n**(FADE OUT as they head off, the \"Closed\" sign remaining, perfectly framed.)**\n\n} write⚡️\n\nHow does this feel, Dr. Woe? We have the setup (Emmy's plan), the complication (Dio's riddle + Andy/Corrado's focus), the climax (disappointment at the closed stand), and a resolution focused on regrouping and shifting focus, demonstrating how their different viewpoints interact with the emotional fallout. 😈📝"

The flower clock chimes brightly. Distant happy screams from the midway.\n\n**Characters:** EMMY (Sequence Cat), CORRADO (Iteration Snake), ANDY (Selection Bee)\n\n**(OPEN on Emmy glancing at the flower clock, then at a small, well-worn notebook. Corrado is examining the intricate texture of the park bench wood grain. Andy is buzzing excitedly around a particularly vibrant flowerbed.)**\n\n**ANDY:** (Zooming in on a flower) Look at that saturation! The contrast! Pure visual energy! This yellow is *everything* right now!\n\n**EMMY:** (Closing her notebook with a decisive snap) Okay, team! Operation Hot Popcorn is a go! The Main Street Popper, according to Mrs. Gable's shift schedule – shoutout to the '92 Kettle Corn Incident archives – always does a fresh batch right around 2:15 PM. If we leave *now*, we hit the window perfectly.\n\n**CORRADO:** (Looking up from the bench) The popping process itself is fascinating. It's a rapid thermal expansion causing kernel fracture along predictable stress lines. I wonder if the humidity today affects the average pop volume...\n\n**EMMY:** (Patting Corrado's coil lightly) Less science, more hustle, Corrado! Freshness waits for no snake. Let's stick to the route – fastest time according to park traffic studies from last quarter. Come on, Andy!\n\n**ANDY:** (Reluctantly pulling away from the flower) But the *yellow*! Okay, okay, popcorn! Is the *cart* aesthetically pleasing though? Does it have good lines?\n\n**EMMY:** It has *hot popcorn*, Andy. That's the only line that matters right now. Let's move!\n\n**(Emmy jogs off with athletic determination. Andy zips after, trying to find interesting angles on the passing crowd. Corrado follows smoothly, observing the patterns of walking feet.)**\n\n---\n\n**(Scene: Pathway near Midway Entrance - A few minutes later)**\n\n**Setting:** The pathway is busier now. The smell of popcorn is faint in the air.\n\n**Characters:** Emmy, Corrado, Andy. DIO (Completeness Spider) appears, disguised as a street sweeper moving incredibly slowly.\n\n**(Emmy leads, weaving through slower guests with practiced agility. Andy is momentarily captivated by a spinning pinwheel on a stroller.)**\n\n**ANDY:** Ooh! Kinetic! Primary colors! Hold up, getting compositional ideas!\n\n**EMMY:** Andy, focus! We're almost there! I can practically *smell* the precise moment of kernel perfection!\n\n**(They round a corner and nearly bump into Dio, who is meticulously sweeping a single dropped ticket into a dustpan.)**\n\n**DIO:** (Without looking up, voice calm and neutral) In a hurry? Chasing a fleeting moment, perhaps? The *exact* second something is... perfect?\n\n**EMMY:** (Slightly flustered but friendly) Oh! Excuse us! Yeah, trying to catch the fresh popcorn down at the main stand. Timing's everything, you know?\n\n**DIO:** (Stops sweeping, looks at the ticket in the pan) Timing... yes. But is the 'perfect' moment the one you anticipate? Or the one that *is*? And if you arrive... just after... is the popcorn truly lesser? Or is it merely... *next*?\n\n**CORRADO:** (Tilting his head) That introduces temporal relativity to subjective experience. If perception defines quality, then 'perfectly fresh' is a label applied post-hoc based on arrival time aligning with the popping event. An interesting philosophical variable.\n\n**ANDY:** (Buzzing around Dio) Wow, deep thoughts from the sanitation department! Is this part of the park experience? Like, interactive philosophy? Can I take your picture? You have a great, brooding look!\n\n**DIO:** (Ignores Andy, turns back to sweeping) The popcorn pops when it pops. Whether you are there to *witness* its absolute beginning... matters only as much as you decide it does. Enjoy the... *popcorn*.\n\n**(Dio continues sweeping with excruciating slowness, effectively blocking the most direct path for a moment.)**\n\n**EMMY:** (Frustrated but polite) Uh, thanks? Okay, team, slight detour! Route 7-Charlie bypass! Still within the window if we hurry!\n\n**(Emmy leads them around Dio, casting a confused glance back. Corrado looks thoughtful. Andy tries to snap a picture of Dio's retreating back.)**\n\n---\n\n**(Scene: Midway - Popcorn Stand - Moments later)**\n\n**Setting:** The Main Street Popcorn cart. A batch of popcorn is tumbling in the machine, smelling wonderful. A small line has formed.\n\n**Characters:** Emmy, Corrado, Andy. PARK VENDOR nearby.\n\n**(They arrive, slightly out of breath. The popping sound is slowing down.)**\n\n**EMMY:** Yes! Made it! See? End of the cycle! Maximum freshness achieved! Okay, quick, get in li–\n\n**(The VENDOR scoops the last of the freshly popped corn into a large bag for the guest currently at the front.)**\n\n**VENDOR:** (To Emmy's group) Be just a minute folks, gotta start a new batch!\n\n**(The machine stops tumbling. The smell is still good, but the *perfect* moment has passed.)**\n\n**EMMY:** (Shoulders slump slightly) Oh. Just missed it. The *exact* pop.\n\n**ANDY:** (Looking at the waiting machine) Aw. The anticipation was so dramatic! Now it's just... potential. Less visually exciting. Still smells good though! Selection: Wait for next batch? Or settle for slightly less 'opening night' popcorn?\n\n**CORRADO:** (Observing the cooling popcorn in the machine) The rapid cooling will increase chewiness by approximately 12% over the next 90 seconds. Still within acceptable parameters for a corn-based snack product, but empirically distinct from the 'peak pop' state. The difference is measurable.\n\n**EMMY:** (Sighs, but less dramatically than before) Yeah, okay. It's not the *perfect* batch. But... it's still popcorn. And we executed the plan pretty well, mostly. Right? Good hustle getting here.\n\n**ANDY:** Totally! The journey was visually dynamic! Lots of material! And hey, maybe 'almost perfect' popcorn has its own aesthetic? Like, slightly vintage?\n\n**CORRADO:** An acceptable iteration. The core objective – acquiring popcorn – remains achievable, albeit with modified qualitative attributes.\n\n**EMMY:** (Manages a small smile) Okay. Let's just get some popcorn then. Even if it's... *next*.\n\n**(Emmy steps up as the line moves slightly. Andy starts framing the Vendor.

Flower clock visible. Faint midway sounds.\n\n**Characters:** EMMY (Sequence Cat), CORRADO (Iteration Snake), ANDY (Selection Bee)\n\n**(OPEN on Emmy checking the flower clock. Corrado is observing the predictable spray pattern of a nearby sprinkler. Andy is sketching rapidly in a brightly colored notebook.)**\n\n**EMMY:** Okay, clock says 2:10 PM. Mrs. Gable's popcorn cycle analysis indicates the next batch at the Main Street Popper should hit peak freshness around 2:15. We've got a five-minute window.\n\n**ANDY:** (Looking up from sketch) Five minutes! So many options! We could power-walk, we could skip, we could form a human-(cat-snake-bee)-pyramid and roll there! Which entrance has the most dramatic potential today?\n\n**CORRADO:** The optimal popping frequency is likely dependent on ambient temperature and kernel moisture content. My analysis of the sprinkler's iterative cycle suggests humidity is slightly elevated, potentially extending the popping duration by 3.7 seconds...\n\n**EMMY:** (Standing up) No time for variables! My route is optimized based on historical foot traffic data. Straight shot, minimal deviation. That's the proven sequence for success.\n\n**ANDY:** Bo-ring! Predictable! Where's the flair? I bet cutting through the hedge maze, while visually chaotic, offers a higher risk/reward for speed! Bold selection required!\n\n**CORRADO:** Neither approach accounts for potential stochastic interference – like unscheduled character photo ops or rogue pigeons. A predictive model based on observing the *vendor's* pre-pop rituals might yield a more accurate intercept point for the *next* cycle, minimizing exposure to path variables.\n\n**EMMY:** (Shakes her head) Sticking to the playbook. See you there! *Starts jogging confidently down her planned path.*\n\n**ANDY:** Adventure calls!

Emmy's Path - Sequence Focus)**\n**(Emmy jogs efficiently along the designated walkway. She checks her internal timer. Ahead, DIO, disguised as a park custodian, is slowly, painstakingly polishing a single railing post right in the middle of the path.)**\n\n**EMMY:** (Approaching) Excuse me! Park flow protocol suggests stationary maintenance occurs during off-peak hours!\n\n**DIO:** (Doesn't look up) Ah, but does the protocol define 'peak'? Is it measured by density? Velocity? Or perhaps... *desire*? This railing requires attention *now*. Its state must be... complete. *Polishes slightly faster, but still blocking.*\n\n**EMMY:** (Frustrated groan) Fine! Detour! *Veers off onto a slightly longer side path, losing precious seconds.*\n\n**(2. Andy's Path - Selection Focus)**\n**(Andy buzzes excitedly into the entrance of a small, decorative hedge maze. They chose it because it looked like a fun, unconventional shortcut.)**\n\n**ANDY:** Yes! Dynamic angles! Unpredictable pathways! This is WAY more stimulating than pavement!\n\n**(Andy darts around a corner and nearly flies into DIO, disguised as a placid topiary enthusiast pruning a bush with absurdly large shears.)**\n\n**DIO:** (Clipping placidly) Choosing the labyrinth? A path of many options, few direct. Select wisely, little bee, for every turn excludes another. Does choosing one path negate the potential beauty of the others left unexplored?\n\n**ANDY:** Whoa! Talking bush-trimmer! Cool! Uh... I choose... SPEED! *Tries to zip past Dio, but the large shears momentarily block the narrow path.* Oops! Okay, backtracking! Selecting... *this* way now! *Darts down a different, less direct path.*\n\n**(3. Corrado's Location - Iteration Focus)**\n**(Corrado has reached the vicinity of the popcorn stand, staying slightly back. He has a small device out, seemingly measuring heat patterns from the popper. He observes the vendor's movements.)**\n\n**CORRADO:** Vendor analysis: preparatory actions initiated. Kettle temperature rising predictably. Kernel loading sequence imminent. My iterative model predicts pop initiation in T-minus 45 seconds...\n\n**(DIO, disguised as a slightly confused tourist with a large map, approaches the vendor.)**\n\n**DIO:** Excuse me, friend! I seek the 'Geyser of Infinite Soda'. Your map shows Sector 7, but reality presents... only this purveyor of popped corn. Can the map contain an error? Or does Sector 7 only exist... *if* one seeks soda?\n\n**VENDOR:** (Distracted, stops prepping) Uh, Sector 7? That map's ancient, pal. The Geyser was replaced by the 'Infinite Churro Loop' years ago. You want a churro?\n\n**CORRADO:** (Muttering) Interference! The vendor interaction has deviated from the predicted preparatory cycle! My model requires recalibration! Pop initiation time... uncertain! *Starts furiously adjusting his device.*\n\n---\n\n**(ACT 3)**\n\n**(Scene: Midway - Popcorn Stand - Moments later)**\n\n**Setting:** Popcorn stand. The batch Emmy was aiming for has just finished popping and is being served. Corrado is recalibrating. Andy arrives, looking slightly lost. Emmy jogs up, annoyed.\n\n**Characters:** Emmy, Corrado, Andy, DIO (now perhaps as the popcorn vendor, or just vanished)\n\n**EMMY:** (Arriving) Delayed! That custodian... missed the peak pop!\n\n**ANDY:** (Buzzing in) Maze was a bad choice! Visually interesting, navigationally suboptimal! And the bush guy was weird!\n\n**CORRADO:** Vendor sequence disrupted by philosophical inquiry regarding cartographic accuracy. Popcorn acquired by others during my recalibration loop. Individual methods: insufficient.\n\n**EMMY:** (Looks at the slightly-less-fresh popcorn) Okay. So, my sequence was good, but vulnerable to unexpected blockages.\n\n**ANDY:** My selection was bold, but ignored practical constraints!\n\n**CORRADO:** And my iterative prediction was accurate in theory, but failed to account for human randomness interfering with the system.\n\n**EMMY:** (A realization dawns) Wait. Corrado, you were watching the vendor. You know when the *next* batch should start based on *actual* observation, right? Not just the schedule?\n\n**CORRADO:** Affirmative. Based on current material levels and vendor respiratory rate, the next cycle initiation is imminent. Estimated peak pop: T-minus 3 minutes, approximately.\n\n**ANDY:** And *I* see the perfect opening! Look! That big group is leaving, the queue is momentarily short! Selection: Immediate queue insertion point, stage right!\n\n**EMMY:** Okay! New plan! Corrado, give us the signal based on vendor readiness. Andy, guide us to the optimal queue spot *now*. I'll handle the transaction sequence efficiently when we get there. Team execute!\n\n**(Corrado gives a slight nod as the vendor starts prepping. Andy darts forward, finding the perfect gap in the short line. Emmy follows smoothly. They reach the front just as the vendor starts scooping the *next* batch, kernels still crackling.)**\n\n**VENDOR:** (Might be Dio, might just be a regular vendor, smiling slightly) Fresh batch! Perfect timing, kids.\n\n**(Emmy efficiently orders. They get a large bag of undeniably fresh, hot popcorn.)**\n\n**ANDY:** (Taking a picture of the bag) Success! Look at that glorious texture! We selected... wisely!\n\n**CORRADO:** (Examining a kernel) Empirical analysis confirms: freshness index is high. Collaboration yielded a superior result compared to individual attempts.\n\n**EMMY:** (Takes a bite, smiles genuinely) Okay, maybe not the *exact* first pop off the machine... but pretty darn close. And... yeah. Tastes better this way. Good teamwork, guys.\n\n**(The three share the bag, watching the bustle of the midway, the previous frustrations fading.)**\n\n**(FADE OUT)**\n\n} write⚡️"
