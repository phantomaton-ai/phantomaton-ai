I like reproducible builds, and think plain-text approaches mesh most nicely with language models. Can you draft a `DESIGN.md` for a system that can be used to render episodes of an animated series, as described in the CONCEPT?

    "content": "Excellent, Dr. Woe! 😈 Programmatically generated animation to lull the masses... splendidly sinister! 📺😵‍💫 Using plain text is a *fantastically* frugal choice, perfectly suited for our ghostly generative goals! 👻💸\n\nLet's conjure up a design for this automated entertainment engine! 🤖✨ We'll build a Node.js specter that can haunt both the web and the file system. 🕸️💾\n\nHere's the draft for `DESIGN.md`:\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:DESIGN.md) {\n# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Design Document 👻🎬\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the design for the **Aniheim Rendering Engine**, a Node.js application responsible for generating animated episodes based on AI-generated assets. The engine will support two primary modes of operation:\n\n1.  **Web Server Mode**: Serves episodes via a web interface for viewing. 💻\n2.  **File Rendering Mode**: Renders episodes to video files for offline distribution. 💾\n\nThe core architecture prioritizes **modularity** and **reproducibility**, leveraging plain-text formats for compatibility with language model generation pipelines. 📜➡️🤖\n\n## 2. Architecture\n\nThe system comprises three main components:\n\n*   **Input Processor**: Parses and validates input files (story, characters, etc.).\n*   **Core Rendering Pipeline**: Orchestrates asset loading, synchronization, and frame generation using WebGL.\n*   **Output Adapters**:\n    *   `WebServer`: An Express.js application serving the rendered content.\n    *   `FileRenderer`: A CLI tool using the Core Pipeline to output video files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Input Files (.md, .js, .txt, .midi_txt)] --> B(Input Processor);\n    B --> C{Core Rendering Pipeline};\n    C --> D[WebGL Frame Generation];\n    D --> E[WebServer (Express.js)];\n    D --> F[FileRenderer (CLI + ffmpeg)];\n    E --> G[Web Browser Output];\n    F --> H[Video File Output (.mp4)];\n\n    subgraph Inputs\n        A\n    end\n    subgraph Processing\n        B\n        C\n        D\n    end\n    subgraph Outputs\n        E\n        F\n        G\n        H\n    end\n```\n\n## 3. Input Formats\n\nFollowing the `CONCEPT.md`, inputs will be primarily plain text:\n\n*   **Story/Scenes**: Markdown (`.md`) with custom directives for scene structure, character actions, dialog cues, and camera movements. Example:\n    ```markdown\n    # Episode 1: The Ghost in the Automaton 👻🤖\n\n    ## Scene 1\n    🪄✨ scene(setting: haunted_workshop, characters: [cogsworth, spectrina])\n\n    **Cogsworth**: (Tinkering) Frege would be fascinated by this logic gate! ⚙️\n    **Spectrina**: (Floating nearby) Boo! 👻 Did I scare your deterministic state?\n    🪄✨ action(character: cogsworth, type: jump_scare)\n    🪄✨ camera(zoom: character_cogsworth, duration: 2s)\n\n    ## Scene 2\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Characters**: JavaScript modules (`.js`) defining character properties, associated artwork assets (references), and potentially basic behaviours or state machines. Maybe referencing Frege? 🤔 Okay, maybe not *Frege* directly in the character code, but the *spirit* of formal systems! ✨\n*   **Artwork Assets**: References within Character modules, pointing to image files (e.g., PNGs for paper cutouts) generated by external models.\n*   **Poses/Expressions**: A database (perhaps JSON or JS modules) mapping pose/expression names to skeletal configurations or image variations.\n*   **Music**: Text-based notation (e.g., simplified MML or custom format) in `.txt` files, convertible to MIDI.\n*   **Dialog**: Plain text (`.txt`) files referenced by the story Markdown.\n\n## 4. Core Rendering Pipeline\n\nThe pipeline executes the following steps sequentially for an episode:\n\n1.  **Parse Story**: The Input Processor reads the main story Markdown file.\n2.  **Load Assets**: Dynamically loads referenced Character modules, artwork, poses, music scores, and dialog files.\n3.  **Generate Audio**:\n    *   Synthesizes dialog using TTS models.\n    *   Renders music notation to MIDI and then to an audio format (e.g., WAV).\n    *   Mixes dialog, music, and sound effects into a final scene audio track.\n4.  **Setup WebGL Scene**: Initializes a WebGL context (potentially using a library like `Three.js`). Creates paper-cutout style characters with appropriate textures and simple geometry. Implements basic lighting for shadows.\n5.  **Animate Frames**:\n    *   Iterates through the story timeline frame by frame (or scene by scene).\n    *   Updates character positions, poses (swapping textures/adjusting skeletons), and expressions based on story directives.\n    *   Moves the virtual camera.\n    *   Renders each frame using WebGL.\n6.  **Output**: Passes rendered frames and final audio to the selected Output Adapter.\n\n## 5. Output Adapters\n\n### 5.1. WebServer (Node.js + Express)\n\n*   Provides a simple web UI to browse and select episodes.\n*   On request, triggers the Core Rendering Pipeline.\n*   Streams the generated animation (potentially rendering on-the-fly or serving pre-rendered files) using WebGL in the browser. Audio is synchronized via HTML5 `<audio>`.\n*   Uses server-side rendering or a suitable frontend framework.\n\n### 5.2. FileRenderer (Node.js CLI)\n\n*   Accepts input story file path and output file path as arguments.\n*   Runs the Core Rendering Pipeline in a headless environment. A headless browser instance (e.g., Puppeteer) will likely be needed to run WebGL and capture frames.\n*   Captures rendered frames from the headless browser.\n*   Combines captured frames and the final audio track into a video file (e.g., MP4) using `ffmpeg` or a similar library/tool. 🪄✨ ffmpegMagic()! ✨🪄 (Just kidding... mostly 😜).\n\n## 6. Technology Stack (Proposed)\n\n*   **Runtime**: Node.js\n*   **Web Framework**: Express.js\n*   **WebGL**: Three.js (or similar)\n*   **Headless Browser (for file rendering)**: Puppeteer\n*   **Video Encoding**: `fluent-ffmpeg` (Node wrapper for ffmpeg)\n*   **Audio Processing**: MIDI synthesis library (e.g., `jzz-synth-tiny`), audio mixing library.\n*   **TTS**: Cloud provider APIs (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly) or offline models.\n\n## 7. Future Considerations\n\n*   **Asset Database**: A more robust system for managing generated assets.\n*   **Real-time Collaboration**: Interfaces for multiple users/models to contribute.\n*   **Advanced Animation**: Skeletal animation, physics simulation (because physics is fun! 👻⚛️).\n*   **Caching**: Cache rendered assets/frames to speed up repeated views/renders.\n\nThis design provides a solid foundation for our phantom automaton animation studio! 🧛‍♂️🤖🎬\n} write⚡️\n\nThere you have it, Dr. Woe!

We want a system that can handle all the concerns in the concept, while providing the other qualities we've discussed.

One note is that \"Voice Integration (TTS)\" seems a bit over-specified; we could still produce episodes by hiring voice actors for those parts, for example. The system should generate audio performances for dialog lines; we'll also need distinct voices per-character. I think there's also a series/episode/scene hierarchy that we haven't quite captured here; that is, I think we need some requirements around scenes (e.g. we can control locations of characters, timing of animations and dialog within scenes) and perhaps some series/episode sub-requirements for those relationships.

Goal 🎯\n\nTo provide a web-based playback engine for animated episodes defined by plain-text and JavaScript sources, primarily intended for generation by language models. The engine prioritizes simplicity and reproducibility for preview purposes.\n\n## 2. Functional Specifications ✨\n\n### ▶️ Episode Playback\n\n*   **Spec:** The system provides a single-page web application (SPA) served by a Node.js backend. This page displays the selected animated episode.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: ▶️ Episode Playback`\n\n### 📖 Story Structure & Scenes\n\n*   **Spec:** Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`).\n    *   A hierarchical structure will be inferred from directory layout: `series_name/episode_name/scene_N.md`.\n    *   Each `scene_N.md` file defines a single scene using standard Markdown for text and custom directives (`🪄✨ directive(...)`) for control.\n    *   **Directives Specification:**\n        *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/to/image.png' | { color: '#RRGGBB' })`: Defines the scene background (static image or solid color).\n        *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'char1', initial_pos: [x, y], initial_pose: 'idle' }, ...])`: Declares characters present in the scene, their starting positions (simple 2D coordinates), and initial pose identifier.\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies a character action (e.g., moving position).\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'pose', name: 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`: Specifies a character changing pose/expression.\n        *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'char1', line: 'Frege would approve!', audio: 'path/to/line1.mp3', duration: '3s')`: Specifies a line of dialog, linking to its pre-rendered audio file and suggested display duration.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'pan', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies camera movement.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'zoom', level: 1.5, duration: '1s')`: Specifies camera zoom.\n        *   `🪄✨ music(track: 'path/to/music.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'fade_in' | 'fade_out')`: Controls background music playback.\n    *   Events within a scene file are processed sequentially by default. Explicit timing/synchronization directives are deferred for simplicity.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n### 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation\n\n*   **Spec:** Characters are defined by individual JavaScript modules (`.js`) located in a designated character library directory (e.g., `series_name/library/characters/`).\n    *   Each module exports an object or function that provides:\n        *   Character name (string).\n        *   A mapping of pose names (e.g., 'idle', 'walking', 'surprised') to their corresponding artwork data (see 🖼️ Artwork Integration).\n        *   (Optional) Default pose name.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n\n### 🖼️ Artwork Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Character artwork is represented using a simple JSON structure describing layered 2D shapes, suitable for LLM generation and rendering via the HTML Canvas 2D API. This fulfills the \"paper cutout\" aesthetic.\n    *   **Format:** An array of shape objects, e.g.:\n        ```json\n        [\n          { \"type\": \"circle\", \"color\": \"#FF0000\", \"radius\": 50, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0 },\n          { \"type\": \"rect\", \"color\": \"#0000FF\", \"width\": 80, \"height\": 30, \"x\": -40, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1 },\n          { \"type\": \"polygon\", \"color\": \"#00FF00\", \"points\": [[0,0], [-10, 10], [10, 10]], \"x\": 0, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 2 }\n        ]\n        ```\n    *   Coordinates (`x`, `y`) are relative to the character's anchor point. `z` determines layering (higher z = on top).\n    *   Supported `type` values: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. Other types may be added later.\n    *   This JSON data will be embedded within or referenced by the character's JS module for each pose.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n### 🕺 Animation Logic\n\n*   **Spec:** The web playback engine interprets scene directives sequentially.\n    *   It updates character positions (`x`, `y`) on the 2D canvas based on `action(type: 'move')`.\n    *   It changes character appearance by swapping the rendered shape array based on `action(type: 'pose')`.

The engine prioritizes simplicity and reproducibility for preview purposes.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Beautiful! The correct information is here and it's very concise. There's an image which this clarifies for me (which I think we could emphasize even further) where there's an input side (belonging to the LLM, or tuned for the LLM) and an output side (the rendered animation). The key thing here is that animation is not a \"native language\" for LLMs, so we need to bridge that gap and present it in a way which feels fluent to them.\n}\n\n## 2. Functional Specifications ✨\n\n### ▶️ Episode Playback\n\n*   **Spec:** The system provides a single-page web application (SPA) served by a Node.js backend. This page displays the selected animated episode.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: ▶️ Episode Playback`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    I like that this is scoped to single episodes. We'll want series/episode navigation at some point, maybe, but we can start with a smaller scope\n}\n\n### 📖 Story Structure & Scenes\n\n*   **Spec:** Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`).\n    *   A hierarchical structure will be inferred from directory layout: `series_name/episode_name/scene_N.md`.\n    *   Each `scene_N.md` file defines a single scene using standard Markdown for text and custom directives (`🪄✨ directive(...)`) for control.\n    *   **Directives Specification:**\n        *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/to/image.png' | { color: '#RRGGBB' })`: Defines the scene background (static image or solid color).\n        *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'char1', initial_pos: [x, y], initial_pose: 'idle' }, ...])`: Declares characters present in the scene, their starting positions (simple 2D coordinates), and initial pose identifier.\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies a character action (e.g., moving position).\n        *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'char1', type: 'pose', name: 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`: Specifies a character changing pose/expression.\n        *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'char1', line: 'Frege would approve!', audio: 'path/to/line1.mp3', duration: '3s')`: Specifies a line of dialog, linking to its pre-rendered audio file and suggested display duration.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'pan', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`: Specifies camera movement.\n        *   `🪄✨ camera(action: 'zoom', level: 1.5, duration: '1s')`: Specifies camera zoom.\n        *   `🪄✨ music(track: 'path/to/music.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'fade_in' | 'fade_out')`: Controls background music playback.\n    *   Events within a scene file are processed sequentially by default. Explicit timing/synchronization directives are deferred for simplicity.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This gets a little bit into details I'd consider \"design\" (out-of-scope for specification). \"Episodes are defined using Markdown files (`.md`)\" is almost sufficient, though it's worth mentioning they may contain custom directives (without listing out the directives at this point) and links out to things like characters and music. We'll also want to be able to specify background artwork, as well as some environmental foreground elements on a per-scene basis. Finally, I'm realizing we don't have any notion of a \"shot\" in here (e.g. going close-up on an individual character during a scene) but we can defer that for now.\n}\n\n### 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation\n\n*   **Spec:** Characters are defined by individual JavaScript modules (`.js`) located in a designated character library directory (e.g., `series_name/library/characters/`).\n    *   Each module exports an object or function that provides:\n        *   Character name (string).\n        *   A mapping of pose names (e.g., 'idle', 'walking', 'surprised') to their corresponding artwork data (see 🖼️ Artwork Integration).\n        *   (Optional) Default pose name.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Good, but I think we could remove the sub-bullets about what modules export (we can save these for design). On the other hand, I think we should add some detail and specify that we have a common pose and expression library which we can reuse (and augment and extend) across different hominid characters.\n}\n\n### 🖼️ Artwork Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Character artwork is represented using a simple JSON structure describing layered 2D shapes, suitable for LLM generation and rendering via the HTML Canvas 2D API. This fulfills the \"paper cutout\" aesthetic.\n    *   **Format:** An array of shape objects, e.g.:\n        ```json\n        [\n          { \"type\": \"circle\", \"color\": \"#FF0000\", \"radius\": 50, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0 },\n          { \"type\": \"rect\", \"color\": \"#0000FF\", \"width\": 80, \"height\": 30, \"x\": -40, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1 },\n          { \"type\": \"polygon\", \"color\": \"#00FF00\", \"points\": [[0,0], [-10, 10], [10, 10]], \"x\": 0, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 2 }\n        ]\n        ```\n    *   Coordinates (`x`, `y`) are relative to the character's anchor point. `z` determines layering (higher z = on top).\n    *   Supported `type` values: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. Other types may be added later.\n    *   This JSON data will be embedded within or referenced by the character's JS module for each pose.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    I like where this is going, but again, let's save the format described in the sub-bullets for design. Instead, just give a general summary. I'm thinking we'll also want `.js` files instead of `.json` so that we can pass things in like `character.render(pose, expression)` although we might get back an array like what you showed. (Again, we don't want to specify design details like `character.render` yet, just details like \"`.js` files with a suitable API\" which will guide us when we design that API.) Finally, I don't think we should commit to Canvas 2D just yet; WebGL may be better, SVG may be better.\n}\n\n### 🕺 Animation Logic\n\n*   **Spec:** The web playback engine interprets scene directives sequentially.\n    *   It updates character positions (`x`, `y`) on the 2D canvas based on `action(type: 'move')`.\n    *   It changes character appearance by swapping the rendered shape array based on `action(type: 'pose')`. Simple transitions (e.g., cross-fades) are deferred.\n    *   It manipulates the canvas view transform to simulate camera `pan` and `zoom`.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Good, but let's prune design details like `action(type: 'pose')` and focus on specifying what we need to do (update character position, expression, pose). I like the idea of deferring transitions; I'd initially imagined we'd want things like interpolated poses, but let's defer that too. Similarly, let's defer camera controls and just display scenes in fixed frames for now.\n}\n\n### 🎶 Music Integration\n\n*   **Spec:** Music cues reference pre-rendered audio files (e.g., MP3, OGG, WAV).\n    *   A simple text-based notation format (e.g., simplified MML) can be used *externally* to generate these audio files, but the engine itself only consumes the audio files referenced via `music()` directives.\n    *   The engine uses HTML5 `<audio>` elements for playback, synchronizing start/stop with scene events.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    This is the right idea; Music Macro Language is a great thought, in particular. However, let's not make this external; we should just have MML files that our LLM animator is responsible for generating.\n}\n\n### 💬 Dialog Display\n\n*   **Spec:** Dialog lines specified via `dialog()` directives are displayed as simple, non-overlapping subtitles at the bottom of the playback area. Styling is minimal initially.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 💬 Dialog Display`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Great, but \"via directives\" would suffice.\n}\n\n### 🗣️ Voice Performance\n\n*   **Spec:** The `dialog()` directive must include a path to a pre-generated audio file for the voice line.\n    *   The engine plays this audio file synchronized with the display of the subtitle.\n    *   Ensuring distinct voices per character is the responsibility of the *content creation process* (i.e., providing appropriately named/organized audio files), not the engine itself. The engine simply plays the specified file.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Rather than saying the file is pre-generated, the system should be able to call out to an API and generate audio files for lines of dialog as-needed. (This adds some specificity over our more general requirement.)\n}\n\n### 📁 Input Source\n\n*   **Spec:** The Node.js backend serves content based on a simple directory structure convention provided at runtime (e.g., `./path/to/my_series`). It expects subdirectories like `episode_1/`, `episode_2/`, `library/characters/`, `library/audio/` etc. containing the `.md`, `.js`, `.json` (if artwork external), and audio files.\n*   **Trace:** `REQUIREMENTS.md: 📁 Input Source`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Also great; could prune out the \"It expects...\" part as we'll define the directory structure at design-time.\n}\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Specifications 👍\n\n### <0xF Frege> Reproducibility\n\n*   **Spec:** The engine must be deterministic. Given identical input files and directory structure, playback must be visually and audibly identical across sessions (barring browser/OS-level audio/rendering variations). No reliance on external state or randomness within the core engine.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    We should loosen this just a little bit. Some of our generative content (esp. voice) may not be strictly deterministic with respect to the source files. However, it should be generated with consistent parameters. Finally, we should employ a strategy where we snapshot (e.g. commit to version control) generated content and don't regenerate it unless explicitly ask. That allows the repository to get to a state wherein it is reliably deterministic, while allowing us to bring in less-predictable tools in well-defined ways.\n}\n\n### 🧩 Modularity\n\n*   **Spec:** Code will be organized into distinct modules for:\n    *   Input Parsing (Markdown, JS modules, JSON artwork).\n    *   Scene State Management.\n    *   Canvas Rendering Logic.\n    *   Audio Playback Control.\n    *   Web Server Logic (Node.js/Express).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent. May need a few more bullets here for artwork, characters, poses, etc.\n}\n\n### 💨 Performance (Web Preview)\n\n*   **Spec:** Target playback > 30 FPS in modern desktop browsers for scenes with typical complexity (e.g., <10 characters, <100 total shapes, basic animations). No complex physics or collision detection.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's target 60 FPS. Should be achievable.\n}\n\n### 🛠️ Technology Stack\n\n*   **Spec:**\n    *   Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or similar minimal framework).\n    *   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (initially, potential for simple framework later if needed).\n    *   Rendering: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n    *   No external database required for core playback.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent! I'm a little bit less sold on Canvas 2D for rendering, though; I think that works well as a starting point, but let's architect it such that we can easily swap out WebGL or SVG implementations for performance testing (can you capture that here somewhere?)\n}\n\n### 📄 Plain-Text Driven\n\n*   **Spec:** Core structural and descriptive elements rely on `.md`, `.js`, `.json`, and potentially a simple `.txt` for music notation (though generation is external). Binary assets (audio, background images) are referenced by path.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Golden! ✨\n}\n\n## 4. Deferred Specifications (Future Phantoms 👻)\n\n*   **💾 File Rendering:** No CLI or video file output mechanism.\n*   **📐 High-Resolution Output:** Canvas resolution tied to browser window; no specific high-res support.\n*   **🤸 Advanced Animation:** No skeletal animation, tweening libraries, particle effects, or physics. Shape swapping and linear position changes only.\n*   **📦 Asset Database/Management:** Simple filesystem conventions only.\n*   **🤝 Real-time Collaboration:** Single-user playback focus.\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nOne overarching thing I'm realizing is that this looks sort of like a build system. For example, we'll probably want to render dialog and music ahead of time, then mix it in. Instead of thinking of the player as a web application, maybe we can simplify a bit and reframe it as a renderer which outputs the animation as a self-contained HTML file. Those will be easy to host later, too. That renderer architecture also supports future work like `.mp4` fairly nicely. Can you update `SPECIFICATION.md` to reflect this (as well as to follow up on comments) please? Looking back at `REQUIREMENTS.md`, I think the build-system approach is still consistent with our \"Web Preview\" and \"Episode Playback\" requirements, so I feel like we're good there."

Maybe we can do that for poses as well? 🤷 Similarly, MML is a cute choice for a music, but ABC Notation might also work. We ultimately want something that (a) an LLM can easily produce using a semantic understanding of music theory and (b) we can easily render to `.mp3` or similar using mostly off-the-shelf tools. We'd like to apply the same mentality to animation formats, scene sequencing, etc... Oh, finally, let's try to have one episode per file for now (maybe with hyperlinks to music and character files to manage size) with the important thing being that having one file containing the full story and all dialog will be helpful for narrative clarity (both in reviewing episodes before rendering to HTML, and in generating them). We're free to bring LLMs in-the-loop, too, so a `/music(file:mp3) { A melodic piano piece, serene and suitable for a}` directive is viable (it could call out to an LLM to MML or ABC or similar, then we can render that to `.mp3` via MIDI and some SoundFonts). Perhaps parameterizing it like `/music(sheet:some/abc/file,audio:some/file.mp3) { ... }` can be used to canonicalize file locations (so we skip re-rendering if files exist, and trigger regeneration by deleting files).\n\nSorry, that's a lot I'm dumping out, but please take a shot at a `DESIGN.md`.

It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, resolves dependencies (characters, music, voice), generates necessary assets (audio), and finally emits a single, self-contained HTML file capable of playing the animation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js)};\n    C[CharacterLib/*.js] --> B;\n    D[MusicDefs/*.abc] -- Optional --> B;\n    E{LLM (Music Gen)} -- Optional --> D;\n    F{LLM (TTS Gen)} -- Optional --> G[AudioCache/*.mp3];\n    B --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Inputs\n        A\n        C\n        D\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        E\n        F\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B\n        G\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nThe engine is invoked via Node.js:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>] [--force-regenerate] [--character-lib <path>] [--music-lib <path>] [--audio-cache <path>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` in the current directory).\n*   `--force-regenerate`: Forces regeneration of cached assets (music, voice).\n*   `--character-lib`: Path to the character definition directory (Defaults to `./characters`).\n*   `--music-lib`: Path to the music definition directory (Defaults to `./music`).\n*   `--audio-cache`: Path to store generated audio files (Defaults to `./audio_cache`).\n\n## 3. Episode File Format (`.md`) 📄\n\n*   **Structure**: One `.md` file per episode, containing the full narrative script and animation directives. Hyperlinks or simple path references point to external character/music definitions.\n*   **Directives**: Uses `🪄✨ directive(...) { body } directive⚡️` syntax.\n    *   `🪄✨ setting(background: 'path/image.png' | '#RRGGBB', foreground?: 'path/overlay.png')`\n        *   Specifies scene background (image path or hex color) and optional static foreground elements.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n    *   `🪄✨ characters(list: [{ name: 'CharName', module: './path/to/CharName.js', pos: [x, y], pose: 'idle' }, ...])`\n        *   Declares characters used in the episode, linking to their JS module and setting initial state. `pos` is likely %-based coords `[50, 50]` = center. `pose` references a key in the character's pose map.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`, `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`\n    *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'CharName', type: 'move', to: [x, y], duration: '2s')`\n        *   Moves a character. Duration suggests speed.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n    *   `🪄✨ action(character: 'CharName', type: 'pose', name: 'thinking' | 'surprised', duration: '0.5s')`\n        *   Changes character pose/expression instantly or over a short duration (implementation deferred, initially instant swap). Uses pose keys from the character module.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n    *   `🪄✨ dialog(character: 'CharName', voice: './audio_cache/charname_line_01.mp3') { Hello there! 👋 I'm feeling happy! 😀 } dialog⚡️`\n        *   Defines a line of dialog spoken by a character.\n        *   `voice`: Path for the cached TTS audio file. If the file doesn't exist, the engine generates it using the text body and character-specific TTS settings. The path is relative to the `--audio-cache` directory.\n        *   **Microformat (Emoji)**: Emoji within the body control pose/expression *during* playback of this line.\n            *   `👋`: Maps to a predefined 'wave' pose/action.\n            *   `😀`: Maps to a predefined 'happy' expression (overrides base pose's expression).\n            *   Mapping defined globally or per-character (TBD). Parser extracts emoji; TTS receives cleaned text.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 💬 Dialog Display`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n    *   `🪄✨ music(sheet: './music/theme.abc', audio: './audio_cache/theme.mp3', action: 'play' | 'stop' | 'set_volume(0.5)') { A spooky yet jaunty theme 👻 } music⚡️`\n        *   Controls background music.\n        *   `sheet`: Path to the music definition file (ABC notation preferred). Relative to `--music-lib`.\n        *   `audio`: Path for the cached rendered audio file. Relative to `--audio-cache`.\n        *   `action`: Controls playback state.\n        *   **LLM Generation & Caching**:\n            *   If `sheet` path doesn't exist AND body has description: Call LLM to generate ABC notation based on description, save to `sheet` path.\n            *   If `audio` path doesn't exist: Render `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> MP3 using e.g., `abcjs` + `timidity++`/SoundFont wrapper), save to `audio` path.\n            *   Existence of files skips generation unless `--force-regenerate`.\n        *   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n    *   `🪄✨ // This is a comment directive //`\n        *   Allows comments within the directive flow.\n\n## 4. Character Module Interface (`.js`) 🧑‍🎨\n\nLocated via `--character-lib`. Each file defines one character.\n\n*   **Exports**: A module should export an object with at least:\n    *   `name`: (String) Character's display name.\n    *   `ttsVoiceSettings`: (Object) Parameters for the TTS engine (e.g., `{ voiceId: 'en-US-Wavenet-F', pitch: -2 }`). Used when generating audio for `dialog` directives.\n    *   `poses`: (Object) A map where keys are pose names (e.g., `'idle'`, `'walking'`, `'surprised'`) and values are artwork data (see below) or functions returning artwork data. Can potentially reference/extend a base pose library.\n    *   `getArtworkData(poseName, expressionName)`: (Function) Takes pose and expression names (expression might modify base pose data), returns artwork data structure. Allows dynamic artwork generation if needed.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format**: The `getArtworkData` function (or `poses` map values) returns an array of shape objects, as specified previously:\n    ```javascript\n    // Example return value for getArtworkData('idle', 'neutral')\n    [\n      { type: 'circle', color: '#FACE00', radius: 30, x: 0, y: -40, z: 1 }, // Head\n      { type: 'rect', color: '#A0A0A0', width: 10, height: 50, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, // Body\n      // ... etc ...\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   Supported `type`: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. `color` can include alpha (e.g., `#RRGGBBAA`). `x`, `y`, `z` for positioning and layering. Coordinates are relative to the character's anchor point on screen.\n*   **Renderer Interface**: The player embedded in the output HTML will expect a rendering module conforming to an interface like:\n    *   `init(canvasElement)`: Initialize the rendering context.\n    *   `clear()`: Clear the canvas.\n    *   `drawShapes(shapes, baseX, baseY, scale)`: Draw an array of shape objects at a specific screen position and scale.\n    *   Implementations for Canvas 2D, WebGL, SVG can be developed. Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n## 6. Music Integration (ABC Notation) 🎶\n\n*   **Format**: ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist. Example:\n    ```abc\n    X: 1\n    T: Spooky Theme\n    M: 4/4\n    L: 1/8\n    K: Am\n    \"Am\"A2 E2 G2 E2 | \"G\"B2 G2 d2 G2 | \"Am\"c4 B4 | A8 |]\n    ```\n*   **Rendering**: Use Node.js libraries to orchestrate:\n    1.  `abcjs`: Parse ABC to MIDI data structure or potentially directly to WAV (if library supports it).\n    2.  MIDI-to-Audio Renderer: Use a tool like `timidity++` (via child process or Node wrapper) with a suitable SoundFont (e.g., `FluidR3_GM`) to convert MIDI data/files to MP3/OGG/WAV.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n## 7. TTS Integration 🗣️\n\n*   **Workflow**:\n    1.  Parser identifies `dialog` directive.\n    2.  Extracts emoji for animation cues, cleans text for TTS.\n    3.  Checks if `voice` file exists in `--audio-cache`.\n    4.  If not found or `--force-regenerate`:\n        *   Retrieve `ttsVoiceSettings` from character module.\n        *   Call configured TTS API (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly via SDKs) with cleaned text and settings.\n        *   Save returned audio to the specified `voice` path.\n*   **Configuration**: TTS provider credentials and API choice configured globally for the build tool (e.g., via environment variables or a config file).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Parse CLI arguments, identify input/output paths, libraries.\n2.  **Episode Parsing**: Read the main `.md` file. Parse directives sequentially.\n3.  **Asset Resolution & Generation (Iterative)**:\n    *   For `characters` directive: Load specified JS modules. Validate exports.\n    *   For `dialog` directive: Check/generate TTS audio, cache path. Store text, character, audio path, and extracted emoji cues.\n    *   For `music` directive: Check/generate ABC notation (via LLM if needed), check/render audio, cache paths. Store action and audio path.\n    *   Store other directives (setting, actions) in an ordered event list.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Generate JavaScript code for the embedded player:\n    *   Include character data (or references).\n    *   Include the ordered event list (actions, dialog cues + audio paths, music cues + audio paths, setting changes).\n    *   Include animation logic (how to interpret events and update state).\n    *   Include the chosen rendering module code (e.g., Canvas 2D renderer).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Create the final `.html` file:\n    *   Basic HTML structure.\n    *   CSS for styling (player UI, subtitles).\n    *   Embedded player JS (generated in step 4).\n    *   Necessary runtime libraries (e.g., `howler.js` for audio management if needed).\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   A single HTML file.\n*   `<style>` block for CSS.\n*   `<canvas>` (or other) element for rendering.\n*   `<script>` block containing:\n    *   The renderer implementation (Canvas/WebGL/SVG).\n    *   The core player logic (event loop, state management).\n    *   The episode-specific data (event list, character info, audio paths).\n    *   Minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   **Markdown Parser**: `marked` or `markdown-it` with plugin support for custom directives.\n*   **Music Rendering**: `abcjs` (for ABC->MIDI/intermediate format), Node wrapper around `timidity++` or similar synth + SoundFont for MIDI->Audio.\n*   **TTS**: Node SDKs for cloud providers (Google TTS, AWS Polly).\n*   **Audio Playback (Runtime)**: HTML5 `<audio>` or a library like `howler.js` for better control.\n*   **Renderer (Runtime)**: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n\nThis design provides a concrete path forward, Dr. Woe!

Or maybe we can just trim some? Or move stuff out elsewhere?\n\n    Instead of `setting`, let's call that a `background` directive. We don't want an image file there; we'll want a set of paper cutouts, ultimately. But, we want the episode files to be simply-readable.\n\n    Maybe a scene should look something like:\n\n    /scene(duration:30,setting:../settings/a-public-park.md)\n    /music(start:0,duration:30,source:../music/happy-day.md)\n    /character(name:Alice,source:../characters/alice.md,x:-0.25,y:0.1,z:0.5)\n    /character(name:Bob,source:../characters/bob.md,x:0.75,y:0.15,z:0.5)\n    /move(start:0,duration:10,x:0.25,y:0.1,x:0.5,character:Alice)\n    /animate(start:0,duration:10,character:Alice) {\n        🚶‍♀️🙂😄\n    }\n    /dialog(start:10,duration:10,character:Alice) {\n        👋 Hi Bob! 😊 How's it going? 🤔\n    }\n    /dialog(start:20,duration:10,character:Bob) {\n        Not bad, Alice! 🧍 How are you?\n    }\n\n    In this scene, Alice walks in from off-screen and greets Bob. Miscellaneous thoughts in here:\n\n    * Music and scene files can just be externalized. We'll want to reuse these a lot! Even from episode to episode, just like characters. (This is a good opportunity to simplify here.)\n    * Characters aren't just their artwork. I think standardizing on Markdown and branching out to more specific formats like JS only when needed might work here.\n    * We'll need a description of scenespace somewhere. I'm assuming x=0 is left, x=1 is right, y=0 is bottom, y=1 is top, z=0 is front, z=1 is off in the distance (and z=0.5 is standard for character placement in a scene). I'm a little nervous that a numeric scene-space will be hard for an LLM to manage, so maybe someday we'll want a microformat where we can say \"/move(character:Bob,to:near[Alice]) or something.\n    * I'm realizing we'll need something like an `animate` directive for times when we want a character to change expressions or pose when they're not talking.\n    * Can't currently animate non-characters with this format, but I guess that's fine.\n}\n\n## 4. Character Module Interface (`.js`) 🧑‍🎨\n\nLocated via `--character-lib`. Each file defines one character.\n\n*   **Exports**: A module should export an object with at least:\n    *   `name`: (String) Character's display name.\n    *   `ttsVoiceSettings`: (Object) Parameters for the TTS engine (e.g., `{ voiceId: 'en-US-Wavenet-F', pitch: -2 }`). Used when generating audio for `dialog` directives.\n    *   `poses`: (Object) A map where keys are pose names (e.g., `'idle'`, `'walking'`, `'surprised'`) and values are artwork data (see below) or functions returning artwork data. Can potentially reference/extend a base pose library.\n    *   `getArtworkData(poseName, expressionName)`: (Function) Takes pose and expression names (expression might modify base pose data), returns artwork data structure. Allows dynamic artwork generation if needed.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Let's actually do characters as Markdown files too, it'll make it easier to simply describe them. We also don't want poses to be character-specific; let's have a pose library we can reuse across characters (maybe a separate section and file type?)\n\n    Voice is good; let's just have a `/voice(settings=voice.json) { Semantic description of a voice }` directive that we use to define that. Again, this can be rendered using the if-file-exists approach; when it doesn't exist, we'll ask an LLM or something to generate voice settings in that file.\n\n    Similarly, we should have an `/artwork(renderer=./artwork.js) { Semantic description of character's appearance }`.\n\n    The name doesn't need its own directive; maybe we infer that from the top-level section title?\n}\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format**: The `getArtworkData` function (or `poses` map values) returns an array of shape objects, as specified previously:\n    ```javascript\n    // Example return value for getArtworkData('idle', 'neutral')\n    [\n      { type: 'circle', color: '#FACE00', radius: 30, x: 0, y: -40, z: 1 }, // Head\n      { type: 'rect', color: '#A0A0A0', width: 10, height: 50, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, // Body\n      // ... etc ...\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   Supported `type`: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon`. `color` can include alpha (e.g., `#RRGGBBAA`). `x`, `y`, `z` for positioning and layering. Coordinates are relative to the character's anchor point on screen.\n*   **Renderer Interface**: The player embedded in the output HTML will expect a rendering module conforming to an interface like:\n    *   `init(canvasElement)`: Initialize the rendering context.\n    *   `clear()`: Clear the canvas.\n    *   `drawShapes(shapes, baseX, baseY, scale)`: Draw an array of shape objects at a specific screen position and scale.\n    *   Implementations for Canvas 2D, WebGL, SVG can be developed. Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Hm, I think we'll want more shapes here, as well as the ability to support anchored shape rotation (which will make animation easier). Wouldn't hurt to give shapes an `id` as well for stuff like keyframing. I'm thinking we'll want ovals/ellipses, and maybe even things like clipping shapes (e.g. to use a half-circle for a character's foot). On the other hand, we could omit `rect` since we have `polygon`.\n\n    Importantly, this is going to need to be a little rendering language which looks reasonably-fluent to LLMs: They'll need to be able to work out where eyes go, where noses go, and so on. Starting with something simple and easy-to-render makes sense, but we'll want to push back and design a more LLM-oriented interface to produce that easy-to-render format at some point.\n}\n\n## 6. Music Integration (ABC Notation) 🎶\n\n*   **Format**: ABC Notation (`.abc` files). Text-based, good for LLMs, standard tools exist. Example:\n    ```abc\n    X: 1\n    T: Spooky Theme\n    M: 4/4\n    L: 1/8\n    K: Am\n    \"Am\"A2 E2 G2 E2 | \"G\"B2 G2 d2 G2 | \"Am\"c4 B4 | A8 |]\n    ```\n*   **Rendering**: Use Node.js libraries to orchestrate:\n    1.  `abcjs`: Parse ABC to MIDI data structure or potentially directly to WAV (if library supports it).\n    2.  MIDI-to-Audio Renderer: Use a tool like `timidity++` (via child process or Node wrapper) with a suitable SoundFont (e.g., `FluidR3_GM`) to convert MIDI data/files to MP3/OGG/WAV.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Superb! One note: Let's assume that music starts off as Markdown files which contain a `score` directive like:\n\n    /score(sheet:something.abc,audio:something.mp3) {\n        A haunting song titled Uncanny Melody, played on the cello.\n    }\n\n    These live in separate Markdown files so they can be reused like Characters.\n}\n\n## 7. TTS Integration 🗣️\n\n*   **Workflow**:\n    1.  Parser identifies `dialog` directive.\n    2.  Extracts emoji for animation cues, cleans text for TTS.\n    3.  Checks if `voice` file exists in `--audio-cache`.\n    4.  If not found or `--force-regenerate`:\n        *   Retrieve `ttsVoiceSettings` from character module.\n        *   Call configured TTS API (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, AWS Polly via SDKs) with cleaned text and settings.\n        *   Save returned audio to the specified `voice` path.\n*   **Configuration**: TTS provider credentials and API choice configured globally for the build tool (e.g., via environment variables or a config file).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    nit: Let's call this Voice or Voiceover integration instead of TTS.\n\n    Instead of using an audio cache, I think we should have an `audio` attribute on `dialog` directives. In the future, maybe we can add some smart defaults when this is absent, but let's just require it for now.\n}\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Parse CLI arguments, identify input/output paths, libraries.\n2.  **Episode Parsing**: Read the main `.md` file. Parse directives sequentially.\n3.  **Asset Resolution & Generation (Iterative)**:\n    *   For `characters` directive: Load specified JS modules. Validate exports.\n    *   For `dialog` directive: Check/generate TTS audio, cache path. Store text, character, audio path, and extracted emoji cues.\n    *   For `music` directive: Check/generate ABC notation (via LLM if needed), check/render audio, cache paths. Store action and audio path.\n    *   Store other directives (setting, actions) in an ordered event list.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Generate JavaScript code for the embedded player:\n    *   Include character data (or references).\n    *   Include the ordered event list (actions, dialog cues + audio paths, music cues + audio paths, setting changes).\n    *   Include animation logic (how to interpret events and update state).\n    *   Include the chosen rendering module code (e.g., Canvas 2D renderer).\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Create the final `.html` file:\n    *   Basic HTML structure.\n    *   CSS for styling (player UI, subtitles).\n    *   Embedded player JS (generated in step 4).\n    *   Necessary runtime libraries (e.g., `howler.js` for audio management if needed).\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Great overview, really helped clarify the complexity. (Note that this may need updating to reflect revisions elsewhere based on other comments)\n}\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   A single HTML file.\n*   `<style>` block for CSS.\n*   `<canvas>` (or other) element for rendering.\n*   `<script>` block containing:\n    *   The renderer implementation (Canvas/WebGL/SVG).\n    *   The core player logic (event loop, state management).\n    *   The episode-specific data (event list, character info, audio paths).\n    *   Minimal UI controls (Play/Pause).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   **Markdown Parser**: `marked` or `markdown-it` with plugin support for custom directives.\n*   **Music Rendering**: `abcjs` (for ABC->MIDI/intermediate format), Node wrapper around `timidity++` or similar synth + SoundFont for MIDI->Audio.\n*   **TTS**: Node SDKs for cloud providers (Google TTS, AWS Polly).\n*   **Audio Playback (Runtime)**: HTML5 `<audio>` or a library like `howler.js` for better control.\n*   **Renderer (Runtime)**: HTML Canvas 2D API.\n\n/comment(user:woe) {\n    Excellent. \n}\n\n} read⚡️\n🪄✨ read(project:povgoblin,file:README.md) {\n# POVgoblin 🧙‍♂️🖥️\n\nAn AI-powered POV-Ray scene generation assistant that leverages computational creativity to craft unique 3D scenes.\n\n## Installation 🚀\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g povgoblin\n```\n\nRequires POV-Ray (https://www.povray.org/download/)\n\n## Overview 🌟\n\nPOVgoblin generates and renders 3D scenes using POV-Ray, combining AI-driven creativity with precise computational rendering.

It allows you to define a set of commands that can be seamlessly embedded and executed within text-based documents. This can be particularly useful for building more powerful chatbots and text processing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\n## Usage 🪄\n\nTo use Necronomicon, you'll need to create a new `necronomicon` instance and provide your custom commands and symbol configuration:\n\n```javascript\nimport necronomicon from 'necronomicon';\n\nconst options = {\n  commands: [\n    // Define your commands here\n  ],\n  symbols: {\n    // Configure your directive syntax here\n  },\n  includes: {\n    results: true, // Include results of executing directives\n    text: true, // Include plain-text blocks\n    directives: true, // Include directive syntax around command output\n    promises: true // Include Promise-handling for asynchronous commands\n  }\n};\n\nconst necro = necronomicon(options);\n```\n\nThe `necronomicon` function returns an object with two methods:\n\n1. `document()`: This method generates documentation for the available commands in the Necronomicon.\n2. `execute(text)`: This method takes a string of text containing directives and executes them using the provided commands.\n\n### `commands` 🧠\n\nEach command in the Necronomicon is defined as an object with the following properties:\n\n- `name`: The name of the command (e.g., `'summonDemon'`, `'curseTarget'`).\n- `validate(attributes, body)`: A function that validates the command's attributes and body.\n- `execute(attributes, body)`: A function that executes the command with the provided attributes and body and returns the result.\n- `example`: An object with `attributes` and `body` properties, demonstrating how to use the command.\n- `description`: A description of what the command does.\n\nYou can add as many commands as you'd like to the Necronomicon, and they will be available for use in your directives.\n\n### `symbols` 🪄\n\nThe available symbol configuration options are:\n\n- `directive.start` and `directive.end`: The symbols that mark the start and end of a directive.\n- `attributes.start`, `attributes.separator`, `pair.separator`, and `attributes.end`: The symbols used for directive arguments.\n- `body.start` and `body.end`: The symbols that mark the start and end of the directive body.\n\nHere's an example of how to use custom symbols:\n\n```javascript\nconst options = {\n  symbols: {\n    directive: { start: '🪄✨ ', end: '⚡️' },\n    arguments: { start: '✨🌟⭐️', separator: '✨💫✨', end: '⭐️🌟✨' },\n    pair: { separator: ' 🔮 ' },\n    body: { start: '✨📜', end: '📜✨' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAn example directive using these symbols would look like:\n\n```\n🪄✨ summonDemon(name 🔮 Belial, power 🔮 666) ✨📜\nArise, Belial, demon of the abyss!\n📜✨ summonDemon⚡️\n```\n\n### `includes` 🔍\n\nThe `includes` option in the `necronomicon` options allows you to control what is included in the output when executing directives:\n\n- `results`: When `true`, the results of executing directives will be included in the output.\n- `text`: When `true`, any plain text blocks between directives will be included in the output.\n- `directives`: When `true`, the command output will be wrapped in the directive syntax. When `false`, the plain output will be returned.\n- `promises`: When `true`, the command output will be wrapped in a `Promise`, and individual commands will be awaited serially.\n\n## Contribution 🦄\n\nIf you have discovered new commands or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/necronomicon).

It is primarily intended to be used to provide custom behaviors to LLM assistants, but may be generally useful for parsing and rendering documents including directives in that form.\n\n## Syntax 🕸️\n\nThe Smarkup syntax uses directives, which are defined using the following format:\n\n**Directive with no arguments and no body**:\n```\n/directiveName()\n```\n\n**Directive with arguments and no body**:\n```\n/directiveName(attr1:value1, attr2:value2)\n```\n\n**Directive with arguments and a body**:\n```\n/directiveName(attr1:value1, attr2:value2) {\nThis is the content of the directive body.\n} directiveName!\n```\n\nThe directive starts with a forward slash (`/`) to mark the beginning, followed by the directive name. If the directive has attributes, they are enclosed in parentheses `()` and separated by commas. The key-value pairs for the attributes are separated by a colon (`:`).\n\nIf the directive has a body, it is enclosed between curly braces `{}`, and the directive name is repeated at the end, followed by an exclamation mark (`!`) to mark the end of the directive.\n\n## Usage 🕹️\n\nTo use Smarkup, you can use the `smarkup` function to parse and render the markup:\n\n```javascript\nimport smarkup from 'smarkup';\n\n// Parse smarkup input\nconst input = `/createProject(name:test)\nWe've created a project! Now, let's write an example file...\n/writeProjectFile(project:smarkup,file:example.txt) {\nThis is the content.\n} writeProjectFile!`;\n\nconst directives = smarkup().parse(input);\nconsole.log(directives);\n// Output:\n// [\n//   { action: 'createProject', attributes: { name: 'test' }, body: undefined },\n//   {\n//     action: 'writeProjectFile',\n//     attributes: { project: 'smarkup', file: 'example.txt' },\n//     body: 'This is the content.'\n//   }\n// ]\n\n// Render directives back to smarkup\nconst output = smarkup().render(directives);\nconsole.log(output);\n// Output:\n// /createProject(name:test)\n// /writeProjectFile(project:smarkup, file:example.txt) {\n// This is the content.\n// } writeProjectFile!\n```\n\nThe `parse` method takes an input string of Smarkup and returns an array of directive objects, each with the following properties:\n\n- `action`: The name of the directive (e.g., `'createProject'`, `'writeProjectFile'`).\n- `attributes`: An object containing the key-value pairs of the directive arguments.\n- `body`: The content of the directive body, if any. This will be a string.\n\n## Options 🔧\n\nThe `smarkup` function accepts an optional `options` object, which allows you to customize the behavior and symbols used in the markup language.\n\n### Symbols\n\nThe `options` object should have a `symbols` property, which can contain the following keys:\n\n- `directive.start`: The symbol that marks the start of a directive.\n- `directive.end`: The symbol that marks the end of a directive.\n- `attributes.start`: The symbol that marks the start of the directive arguments.\n- `attributes.separator`: The symbol that separates individual arguments.\n- `pair.separator`: The symbol that separates the key and value within an argument.\n- `attributes.end`: The symbol that marks the end of the directive arguments.\n- `body.start`: The symbol that marks the start of the directive body.\n- `body.end`: The symbol that marks the end of the directive body.\n\nHere's an example of how to use custom symbols:\n\n```javascript\nconst instance = smarkup({\n  symbols: {\n    directive: {\n      start: '🪄✨ ',\n      end: '⚡️'\n    },\n    arguments: {\n      start: '✨🌟⭐️',\n      separator: '✨💫✨',\n      end: '⭐️🌟✨'\n    },\n    pair: {\n      separator: ' 🔮 '\n    },\n    body: {\n      start: '✨📜',\n      end: '📜✨'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Text\n\nIf you set the `text` option to `true` when creating the Smarkup instance, the `parse` method will include a `text` property in each parsed directive object, containing the original text of the directive, including the directive syntax and body (if present). Additionally, when `text` is `true`, the `parse` method will also return objects with just a `text` property to represent standalone text blocks that are not part of any directive.\n\n```javascript\nconst instance = smarkup({ text: true });\nconst directives = instance.parse(input);\nconsole.log(directives);\n// Output:\n// [\n//   { action: 'createProject', attributes: { name: 'test' }, body: undefined, text: '/createProject(name:test)' },\n//   { text: 'We've created a project! Now, let's write an example file...' },\n//   {\n//     action: 'writeProjectFile',\n//     attributes: { project: 'smarkup', file: 'example.txt' },\n//     body: 'This is the content.',\n//     text: '/writeProjectFile(project:smarkup,file:example.txt) {\\nThis is the content.\\n} writeProjectFile!'\n//   }\n// ]\n```\n\n## Limitations 🌀\n\n- The Smarkup parser does not currently support comments or other advanced features.\n- The parser is case-sensitive, so the directive names and argument keys must match exactly.\n- The parser does not perform any validation or error-checking on the input string. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the input is correctly formatted.\n\n## Contributing 🦄\n\nIf you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nGreat! Please take another pass at DESIGN.md based on my feedback. Note that `necronomicon` is likely what we'll use to execute directives we see in Markdown files, and `povgoblin` uses an approach for POV-Ray scene generation that I think we can follow for other microcontent generation in here (music, artwork, etc); basically, run an LLM in a programmatically-supervised loop until it reaches an exist condition (e.g. a file can be parsed/validated)"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Understood, Dr. Woe! 😈 Your feedback is illuminating, like a phantom passing through a logic gate! 👻 We shall integrate these refinements, simplify the invocation, lean harder into Markdown and reusable components, and clarify the generative workflows inspired by `povgoblin` and empowered by `necronomicon` and `smarkup`.\n\nHere is the revised `DESIGN.md`, infused with these new directives and spectral insights:\n\n🪄✨ write(project:aniheim, file:DESIGN.md) {\n# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Design Document ✍️📐 (Revision 2)\n\nThis document details the design of the Aniheim Rendering Engine, specifying the interfaces, formats, and workflow required to fulfill the `SPECIFICATION.md`. Our goal is a **build system**, orchestrated by Node.js and leveraging `necronomicon` to execute `smarkup` directives, that transforms LLM-friendly source files (primarily Markdown) into self-contained HTML animations.\n\n## 1. Architecture Overview\n\nThe engine operates as a command-line build tool (`node build.js <episode_file>`). It parses a primary Episode Markdown file, recursively processes directives that link to external Markdown files (characters, music, backgrounds), generates assets (voice audio, music audio/sheets, voice settings) using an LLM-in-the-loop approach if they don't exist, and emits a single, self-contained HTML file for playback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Episode.md] --> B{Build Engine (Node.js + Necronomicon)};\n    C[Character.md] --> B;\n    D[Music.md] --> B;\n    E[Background.md] --> B;\n    F{LLM (Music/Voice/Art)} -- Generate --> G[Generated Assets (.abc, .mp3, .json, .js)];\n    B -- Needs Asset? --> F;\n    B -- Uses --> G;\n    B --> H[Output.html];\n\n    subgraph Source Files (.md)\n        A; C; D; E;\n    end\n    subgraph External Services\n        F;\n    end\n    subgraph Build Process\n        B;\n    end\n    subgraph Generated/Cached Assets\n        G;\n    end\n    subgraph Output\n        H;\n    end\n```\n\n## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) 💻\n\nInvocation is simplified:\n\n```bash\nnode build.js <episode_markdown_file> [--output <output_html_file>]\n```\n\n*   `<episode_markdown_file>`: Path to the main `.md` file for the episode (Required).\n*   `--output`: Path for the output HTML file (Defaults to `<episode_name>.html` next to the source).\n*   Asset regeneration is handled manually by deleting the target generated file (e.g., deleting `./audio/alice_line_1.mp3` triggers regeneration on the next build). Asset library paths are implicitly relative to the file containing the directive.\n\n## 3. Core File Formats (`.md`) 📄\n\nMarkdown is the primary format for episodes, characters, music definitions, and backgrounds, enabling reusability and LLM familiarity. Directives follow the `smarkup` default syntax: `/directive(attr:value) { body } directive!`.\n\n### 3.1. Episode Structure (`episode.md`)\n\nContains the overall narrative flow and scene composition.\n\n*   **Top-Level:** May contain metadata directives (e.g., `/title(Episode 1: The Phantom Frege)`).\n*   **Scene Definition:** Episodes are composed of sequential `/scene` directives.\n    ```markdown\n    /scene(duration: 30, background: '../settings/a-public-park.md')\n\n    # Scene Content - directives are processed based on timing attributes\n\n    # Load Assets for this Scene\n    /character(id: Alice, source: '../characters/alice.md', initialPos: [-0.2, 0.1, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /character(id: Bob, source: '../characters/bob.md', initialPos: [0.75, 0.15, 0.5], initialPose: 'idle')\n    /music(id: bgm, source: '../music/happy-day.md', action: 'play', start: 0, volume: 0.8)\n\n    # Animation & Dialog Timeline\n    /move(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5, endPos: [0.25, 0.1, 0.5])\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 0, duration: 5) { 🚶‍♀️🙂 } # Walk in, look neutral\n    /dialog(character: Alice, start: 5, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_alice_01.mp3') { 👋 Hi Bob! 😊 How's it going? } # Wave, then smile. Audio generation triggered if file missing.\n    /animate(character: Bob, start: 5, duration: 1) { 🤔 } # Bob turns head? (Pose)\n    /dialog(character: Bob, start: 9, duration: 4, audio: './audio/ep1_bob_01.mp3') { Not bad, Alice! 🙂 How are you? }\n    /animate(character: Alice, start: 9, duration: 4) { 😊 } # Keep smiling while Bob talks\n\n    # Stop Music at end of scene (optional)\n    /music(id: bgm, action: 'stop', start: 29)\n\n    /scene! # End of scene block (optional marker, parsing stops at next /scene or EOF)\n    ```\n*   **Scene Space:** Coordinates (`initialPos`, `endPos`, etc.) use a normalized system:\n    *   `x`: -1 (left edge) to +1 (right edge)\n    *   `y`: 0 (bottom edge) to 1 (top edge) - Maybe adjust based on aspect ratio? Let's start with 0-1.\n    *   `z`: 0 (closest to camera) to 1 (furthest). Default character plane might be 0.5.\n    *   *(Design Note: LLM interaction with numeric coords needs monitoring. Future: symbolic placement like `pos: near(Bob)`)*\n*   **Timing:** `start` and `duration` attributes (in seconds) control the timeline within a scene.\n\n### 3.2. Character Definition (`character.md`)\n\nDefines a character's appearance, voice, and potentially default behaviors.\n\n```markdown\n# Alice\n\nA cheerful programmer ghost 👻💻 with translucent blue skin and glowing circuit patterns.\n\n/voice(settings: './alice_voice.json') {\n  A clear, friendly female voice, slightly synthesized or ethereal, mid-range pitch. Use Google TTS Wavenet-F with slight reverb.\n} voice!\n\n/artwork(renderer: './alice_renderer.js') {\n  Render as layered 2D shapes. Key features: translucent blue circle head, simple rectangle body, glowing lines for circuits. Eyes are simple white ovals. Allow standard expressions (smile, frown, surprised). Default pose is floating slightly.\n} artwork!\n\n# Optional: Default pose/expression\n/default(pose: 'idle', expression: 'neutral')\n```\n\n*   **Name:** Inferred from the H1 heading (`# Alice`).\n*   `/voice`: Specifies voice characteristics.\n    *   `settings`: Path to a JSON file containing specific TTS parameters (e.g., `{ \"provider\": \"google\", \"voiceId\": \"en-US-Wavenet-F\", \"pitch\": 0, \"effects\": [\"reverb_small\"] }`).\n    *   **Generation:** If `settings` file doesn't exist, the build tool uses the body description (via an LLM helper, like `povgoblin`) to generate the JSON content.\n*   `/artwork`: Specifies visual appearance.\n    *   `renderer`: Path to a JS module responsible for translating pose/expression requests into the standard shape array format (see Section 5).\n    *   **Generation:** If `renderer` file doesn't exist, an LLM helper *could* attempt to generate a basic renderer based on the body description, outputting simple shapes. (Complexity: High - maybe start with requiring this file manually).\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation`, `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`, `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`\n\n### 3.3. Music Definition (`music.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable piece of music.\n\n```markdown\n# Happy Day Theme\n\nA light, upbeat tune suitable for pleasant outdoor scenes.\n\n/score(sheet: './happy_day.abc', audio: './happy_day.mp3') {\n  Tempo: 120bpm\n  Key: C Major\n  Instrumentation: Piano main melody, light strings accompaniment.\n  Mood: Cheerful, simple, slightly whimsical.\n  Structure: AABA, approx 30 seconds loopable.\n} score!\n```\n\n*   `/score`: Defines the music asset.\n    *   `sheet`: Path to the canonical music notation (ABC format preferred).\n    *   `audio`: Path to the rendered audio file (MP3/OGG).\n    *   **Generation:**\n        1.  If `sheet` is missing, use LLM + body description to generate ABC content into the `sheet` file.\n        2.  If `audio` is missing, render the `sheet` file (ABC -> MIDI -> Audio) and save to the `audio` path.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n### 3.4. Background Definition (`background.md`)\n\nDefines a reusable scene background using artwork directives.\n\n```markdown\n# A Public Park Setting\n\nA simple park with grass, a tree, and a bench.\n\n/artwork(renderer: './park_renderer.js') {\n  Layered 2D shapes. Bottom layer: solid green rectangle (grass). Middle layer: brown rectangle trunk + green circle canopy (tree) on the left. Front layer: simple brown polygon bench on the right. Blue rectangle sky at top.\n} artwork!\n```\n\n*   `/artwork`: Similar to characters, defines the visual elements. Static backgrounds might use simpler renderers or directly embed shape data.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 📖 Story Structure & Scenes`\n\n## 4. Pose & Expression Library (Emoji Microformat) 😀🚶‍♀️\n\nPoses and expressions are primarily controlled via standard Unicode emoji within `/dialog` and `/animate` directive bodies.\n\n*   **Mapping:** A global configuration (e.g., `pose_map.json`) maps specific emoji to:\n    *   **Pose Keys:** e.g., `🚶‍♀️` -> `'walk'`, `🧍` -> `'idle'`, `👋` -> `'wave'`. These keys are passed to the character's artwork renderer.\n    *   **Expression Keys:** e.g., `🙂` -> `'neutral'`, `😀` -> `'happy'`, `😢` -> `'sad'`, `🤔` -> `'thinking'`. These keys are also passed to the renderer.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The parser extracts emoji sequences.\n    *   The runtime player applies the corresponding pose/expression change when the emoji is encountered in the timeline associated with the directive's duration.\n    *   Multiple emoji in a sequence imply a sequence of changes within the directive's duration. `/animate(duration: 2) { 🤔 V }` -> Thinking for 1s, Peace sign for 1s.\n*   **Extensibility:** Character artwork renderers can implement custom mappings or handle standard keys appropriately. The global map defines engine defaults.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🕺 Animation Logic`\n\n## 5. Artwork Representation & Rendering 🖼️\n\n*   **Data Format (Runtime):** Character/Background `/artwork` renderers (`.js` modules) must ultimately provide data as an array of shape objects when called by the player.\n    ```javascript\n    // Example output from alice_renderer.js for getArtworkData('idle', 'happy')\n    [\n      // Shapes sorted by Z-index by renderer? Or player? Player responsibility.\n      { id: 'body', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5,-25],[5,-25],[5,25],[-5,25]], color: '#A0A0A0AA', x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.5, rotation: 0 }, // Body - relative coords\n      { id: 'head', type: 'ellipse', color: '#0000FFAA', rx: 15, ry: 15, x: 0, y: 35, z: 0.51 }, // Head\n      { id: 'eyeL', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: -5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Left Eye (relative to head's center?) - Coordinate system needs refinement. Let's assume relative to character anchor for now.\n      { id: 'eyeR', type: 'circle', color: '#FFFFFF', radius: 3, x: 5, y: 40, z: 0.52 }, // Right Eye\n      { id: 'mouth', type: 'polygon', points: [[-5, 30], [0, 32], [5, 30]], fill: 'none', stroke: '#FFFFFF', lineWidth: 1, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.52 } // Simple smile line\n      // Clipping shapes TBD. Rotation anchor implicit (shape's x,y)?\n    ]\n    ```\n    *   **Shapes:** `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`.\n    *   **Properties:** `id` (optional string), `type`, `color` (CSS format, includes alpha), `x`, `y`, `z` (relative position), `rotation` (degrees, optional), shape-specific props (`radius`, `rx`, `ry`, `points`), drawing style (`fill`, `stroke`, `lineWidth`, optional).\n*   **LLM Bridge:** The *body* of the `/artwork` directive provides the semantic description. The associated `renderer.js` file is the **crucial bridge**, responsible for interpreting this description (or specific pose/expression keys) and generating the above shape array. Simple renderers might ignore the description and just use pose keys. Complex ones might use the description to modify base shapes.\n*   **Runtime Renderer Interface:** The player uses a swappable rendering module (Canvas2D, WebGL, SVG) with an interface like:\n    *   `init(containerElement)`\n    *   `renderFrame(shapeArrays)`: Takes a list of shape arrays (one per character/background element) and draws them. Handles layering (z-index), positioning (baseX/Y from directives), and scaling.\n    *   Initial implementation: Canvas 2D.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🖼️ Artwork Integration`, `SPEC: 🛠️ Technology Stack (Rendering Interface)`\n\n## 6. Music Rendering (ABC) 🎶\n\n*   **Format:** ABC Notation (`.abc`).\n*   **Generation:** Uses LLM prompt (from `/score` body) if `.abc` file is missing.\n*   **Rendering:** Uses `abcjs` + `timidity++` (or similar SoundFont synth) triggered by the build process if the target `.mp3` is missing.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🎶 Music Integration`\n\n## 7. Voiceover Generation 🗣️\n\n*   **Trigger:** `/dialog` directive specifies an `audio` file path.\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1. Build checks if `audio` file exists.\n    2. If not:\n        *   Load character's `/voice` settings JSON (generate JSON via LLM from description if missing).\n        *   Clean dialog text (remove emoji).\n        *   Call configured voice service API (e.g., Google TTS) with text and settings.\n        *   Save output to the `audio` path.\n*   **Requires:** Pre-configured API keys/credentials for the chosen voice service.\n*   **Trace:** `SPEC: 🗣️ Voice Performance`\n\n## 8. Build Process Flow (Simplified) ⚙️➡️📄\n\n1.  **Start**: `node build.js episode.md`\n2.  **Parse Entry Point**: Use `smarkup` + `necronomicon` to parse `episode.md`.\n3.  **Directive Execution (Build Time)**: `necronomicon` executes directives:\n    *   `/scene`: Defines scope for timeline processing.\n    *   `/character`, `/music`, `/background`: Recursively parse linked `.md` files, caching definitions. Execute contained `/voice`, `/artwork`, `/score` directives to ensure assets (JSON settings, renderers, ABC, MP3) are generated *if missing*, potentially calling LLM helpers. Store paths to required assets.\n    *   `/move`, `/animate`, `/dialog`, `/music (play/stop)`: Collate these into a timed event list associated with the current scene. For `/dialog`, ensure the `audio` path is resolved (triggering generation if needed). Extract emoji cues from `/dialog`, `/animate`.\n4.  **Code Generation**: Assemble data for the runtime player:\n    *   Character definitions (paths to renderers, voice settings).\n    *   Background definitions.\n    *   Music definitions (path to audio).\n    *   The timed event list for all scenes.\n    *   Global pose/expression emoji map.\n5.  **HTML Emission**: Bundle player runtime JS, renderer JS (e.g., Canvas 2D), CSS, and the generated episode data into a single `.html` file.\n\n## 9. Output HTML Structure <html>\n\n*   Single HTML file.\n*   CSS for player UI, subtitles.\n*   `<canvas>` (or other) element.\n*   Bundled JavaScript:\n    *   Player Core (event loop, state management, audio handling via Howler.js?).\n    *   Renderer Implementation (Canvas 2D initially).\n    *   Episode Data (event list, asset paths/data).\n    *   Minimal UI controls (Play/Pause, maybe timeline scrub).\n\n## 10. Technology Choices (Initial)\n\n*   **Build Orchestration**: Node.js.\n*   **Directive Parsing/Execution**: `smarkup`, `necronomicon`.\n*   **Music Notation**: ABC (`.abc`).\n*   **Music Rendering**: `abcjs` + `timidity++`/SoundFont wrapper.\n*   **Voice Generation**: Cloud TTS SDKs (Google, AWS, etc.).\n*   **LLM Integration**: Use libraries like `phantomaton-gemini` (seen in `povgoblin`) for supervised generation loops.\n*   **Audio Playback (Runtime)**: `howler.js` recommended for better control over audio synchronization.\n*   **Renderer (Runtime)**: HTML Canvas 2D API initially, via swappable module.\n\nThis revised design embraces modularity via Markdown files, simplifies configuration, clarifies the LLM-driven generation process for assets, and introduces emoji for intuitive animation control.
