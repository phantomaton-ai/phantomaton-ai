Now, we want to use `gallows` like `gallows(commands).execute(directives)`, where `commands` is a list of available commands, whereas directives are specific command invocatiions. Each command needs a `name`, an `execute` function taking two arguments, `attributes` and `body`, a `validate` function taking `attributes` and `body` as well, and an `example` object with `attributes` and `body` present as properties, and a `description` field describing what the command does. Each directive should have an `action` with the name of the command, as well as `attributes` and a `body`. Can you sketch out a README.md for that?"

When executing a command, the first command that passes the `validate` function will be executed. This allows you to provide different implementations of the same command based on the provided attributes and body.\n\nHere's an example of command overloading:\n\n```javascript\ngallows([\n  {\n    name: 'echo',\n    validate: (attributes, body) => body !== undefined,\n    execute: (attributes, body) => body,\n    example: {\n      attributes: {},\n      body: 'Hello, Gallows!'\n    },\n    description: 'Echoes the provided message'\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'echo',\n    validate: (attributes, body) => attributes.message !== undefined,\n    execute: (attributes, body) => `Echo: ${attributes.message}`,\n    example: {\n      attributes: { message: 'Hello, world!' },\n      body: ''\n    },\n    description: 'Echoes the provided message'\n  }\n]).execute(\n  'echo',\n  { message: 'Hello, world!' },\n  ''\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the second `echo` command will be executed, as its `validate` function matches the provided `attributes`.\n\nFeel free to add more commands to your Gallows project!\n\n} writeProjectFile⚡️"
