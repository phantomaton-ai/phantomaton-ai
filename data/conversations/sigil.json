    "content": "🪄✨ read(project:sigil,file:SKETCH.md) {\nThoughts on `sigil` (from Dr. Woe)\n\nIn general, I'd like to do some dependency injection and service compositing.\nMy specific use cases are things like:\n\n* Swapping out LLM models and APIs\n  * Anthropic is great, but I want to be able to run the same code against\n    a variety of chat APIs/models. Consequently, I want to plug in/out\n    different adapters for these.\n* Exposing reusable abilities\n  * Somewhat similarly, I got here because I'd been writing several little\n    prototype chatbots against the Anthropic API, and wanted to spin up \n    different assistants with different abilities more easily. Most specifically,\n    I want to be able to reuse abilities (such as image generation and project\n    authorship) across various agents.\n* Exposing reusable experiences.\n  * Chat interfaces are great, and so I want to be able to reuse them from agent\n    to agent. But, I don't want to over-commit to chat, as there are a lot of \n    different conversation-driven experiences (such as infinite image montages)\n    which I like exploring.\n* Supporting multiple interfaces.\n  * Web interfaces are pretty great, but I've found command-line chatbot interfaces\n    to be super useful as well. I'd like to be able to support a general-purpose\n    experience like \"chat\" and expose multiple different interfaces to that same\n    experience (including REST APIs).\n\nThere are several bigger architectural problems to sort out in there, especially\nin the \"which components and how do they connect\" sense. I don't want to solve that\nin `sigil`, but I do want to give myself a good lightweight tool to make these\narchitectural decisions a little more dynamically.\n\nI've had some previous experience in this problem space, and the architectural\nparadigm I like consists of three major abstractions:\n\n* **Providers**: Specific implementations that can be swapped in and out. For\n  example, the Anthropic adapter mentioned above would be a `Provider` of\n  conversation capabilities.\n* **Aggregator**: Strategies for dealing with multiple providers. For example,\n  we might wish to raise errors if more than one provider is present (for\n  singletons) or do a fan-out/fan-in approach to combine results from mulitple\n  providers (to run the same search across multiple engines, for example).\n* **Decorator**: Wrappers which modify the behavior of other components by\n  intercepting calls, potentially modifying inputs and outputs.\n\nI've used various terms (\"composite services\" comes to mind) to describe these\nbeasts in the past. They ultimately hinge on having good type identifiers.\nStrings work, to a degree, but eventually you run into namespace collisions.\nAdditionally, dealing with well-qualified identifiers at a code-level can\nget unwieldy; but, we like dependency injection to look as fluent and natural\nas possible.\n\n`sigil` is intended to utilize the JavaScript `Symbol` as a coordinating type\nidentifier to solve these problems, \n\n\n```\nimport sigil from 'sigil';\nconst converse = sigil('converse');\nexport default converse;\n```\n\nExample usage to define a provider:\n\n```\nconverse.as(User).like(async (messages) => {\n  show(messages);           // Print \n  return await input('> '); // Get user input\n});\n```\n\nInstances of `User` would then get behavior overridden like:\n\n```\nclass User {\n  converse(messages) {\n    return converse.using(this).upon(messages);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nimport converse from './converse.js';\nclass User {\n  constructor() {\n    this.converse = converse.using(this).upon;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that classes like `User` are under no obligation to use\nthe name `converse`, so naming collision may always be disambiguated;\nthe actual bindings is based on a `Symbol` behind the `sigil`.\n\nI'd like similar fluent syntaxes for defining decorators upon\nsigils as well as providing or overriding the aggregation strategy.\n\nThe top-level module should be `sigil.js` and it should look like:\n\n```\nconst defaults = {};\n\nclass Sigil {\n  constructor(options) {\n    options = options instanceof String ? { name: options } : options;\n    options = { ...defaults, ...options };\n    // etc.\n  }\n  // methods\n}\nconst sigil = (options) => new Sigil(options);\n```\n\n} read⚡️\n\n---\n\nNow, did you see the real file contents?"
