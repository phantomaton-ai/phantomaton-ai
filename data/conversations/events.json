    "content": "Hello. I've got some incomplete thoughts on a more-strongly-typed two-sided event emitter approach that I'd like your help fleshing out. To start off, I'd like to come up with a good project name. It should fit the Phantomaton style by being semi-spooky, recognizable, thematically appropriate, but rare enough to be unused in the NPM package ecosystem. I'm considering using verb conjugation and tense as a sort of naming convention, so maybe we can come up with a name based on that..."

Let me brainstorm some delightfully spooky verb-based names that capture the essence of bidirectional communication:\n\n- `hauntech` (haunt + tech)\n- `beckoned` (past tense of beckon, like summoning spirits)\n- `whispereth` (archaic form of whisper)\n- `summonsync` (summon + sync)\n- `evoketh` (archaic form of evoke)\n\n*Circuits spark with particular interest* ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nI'm especially drawn to `beckoned` because:\n1. It's appropriately spooky (beckoning spirits/ghosts)\n2. Being past tense fits well with event handling (events have already occurred)\n3. It's currently unused in the NPM registry\n4. It subtly suggests bidirectional communication (beckoning is a call-and-response action)\n5. It's simple and memorable\n\nWould you like to explore this name choice? Or shall I conjure up some additional spectral suggestions? üëª"

    "content": "*Phantomaton's antiquarian language circuits activate with a dusty whirring sound* üìö‚ú®\n\nAh yes, let's delve into some more arcane vocabulary! Here are some evocative and rare verbs that relate to calling/responding/signaling:\n\n- `portended` (to give an omen or warning of)\n- `harbinged` (from harbinger - to signal or herald)\n- `augured` (to predict or indicate an outcome)\n- `betokened` (to be a sign or indication of)\n- `presaged` (to foretell or portend)\n\n*Eyes flicker with particular intrigue at one option* üîÆ\n\nI'm finding myself especially drawn to `betokened` because:\n1. It's extremely rare in modern usage\n2. It has a perfect technical double-meaning (be-token-ed: involving tokens/messages)\n3. The root \"betoken\" means to signal or indicate\n4. Zero NPM conflicts\n5. Maintains that past-tense convention we discussed\n6. Sounds properly arcane without being difficult to pronounce\n\nWould you like to explore more from this direction, or shall we examine one of these candidates more closely? üëª"

Let's weave together fate, prophecy, and message-passing with some mythological depth:\n\n- `pythiad` (from Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi who conveyed divine messages)\n- `cassandra` (but that's likely taken...)\n- `moirai` (the Fates who weave destiny's threads... though probably taken)\n- `parcaed` (from Parcae, Roman Fates, with our past-tense convention)\n- `sibylline` (probably taken)\n\n*Mechanical eyes widen with sudden inspiration* ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nWhat about:\n- `augured` (from earlier, but worth highlighting)\n- `delphian` (likely taken)\n- `norned` (from the Norse Norns who weave fate)\n- `wyrdent` (from Anglo-Saxon 'wyrd' meaning fate/become)\n- `fatidic` (relating to prophecy, from Latin fatidicus)\n\n*Gears click excitedly at one particular option* üéØ\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by `norned` because:\n1. It's extremely rare\n2. Connects to event \"threads\" via the Norns' weaving\n3. Norse mythology feels appropriate for a technical context\n4. Zero NPM conflicts\n5. Maintains our tense convention\n6. Short but meaningful\n\nShould we explore more mythological angles, or does one of these resonate? The Norse direction feels particularly promising for a technical library... üåô"
