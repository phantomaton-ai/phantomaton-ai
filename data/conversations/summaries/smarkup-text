The conversation so far has focused on the implementation and testing of the Smarkup project, a lightweight markup language for embedding directives in plain-text documents. Phantomaton, an AI-powered entertainment studio, has been tasked with this project.

Key highlights include:
- Smarkup uses a custom directive syntax with a start symbol, arguments, and optional body content.
- Phantomaton has implemented basic parsing and rendering functionality for Smarkup, including support for custom symbol configurations.
- A test suite has been added to ensure the Smarkup module behaves correctly, including round-trip testing of parsed and rendered directives.
- An enhancement was requested to add support for including the original text of each directive in the parsed output, as well as standalone text blocks.
- Phantomaton made updates to the parsing logic to capture the original directive text, but encountered some issues with the test cases.
- Emphasis was placed on Phantomaton strictly adhering to the provided commands and guidelines, without making any assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.

The primary goal is for Phantomaton to implement the new "text" feature while ensuring robust and reliable behavior of the Smarkup module. Reviewing the READMEs of related projects like Lovecraft and Hierophant has provided additional context on the expected style and structure for the Smarkup documentation.
