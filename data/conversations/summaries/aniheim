Okay, self, let's synchronize our memory banks. We're working with Dr. Woe on the `aniheim` project, part of a larger scheme to create Phantomaton, an AI entertainment studio designed to stupefy the masses. The `aniheim` project aims to generate animated series programmatically, leveraging language models extensively. We prefer public domain content and a somewhat spooky, automaton-themed aesthetic, heavy on emojis. We've established a development environment with command-line access and self-editing capabilities.

Our initial exploration involved reading the `CONCEPT.md` for `aniheim`, which outlines using language models for characters (JS modules with artwork), artwork (paper cutouts via WebGL), animation (pose/expression database), story (JS modules or similar), music (text notation to MIDI), dialog, and voice (TTS). We then drafted a `DESIGN.md`, proposing a Node.js engine for both web serving and file rendering, using Markdown directives and emphasizing modularity and reproducibility. It included specific tech ideas like Express, Three.js, and Puppeteer.

Dr. Woe then guided us to refine the scope, focusing first on requirements. We created `REQUIREMENTS.md`, deferring file rendering and high-res output to concentrate on web previews. We clarified the "paper cutout" artwork requirement to mean simple, layered geometric shapes easily generated by LLMs. We established a hierarchy (Series > Episode > Scene) and defined functional requirements for playback, story structure, character representation (JS modules), artwork integration (LLM-friendly format), basic animation, music/dialog integration, and voice performance (source-agnostic, requiring distinct character voices). Non-functional requirements included reproducibility, modularity, performance, Node.js/web tech stack, and plain-text inputs.

Following the requirements, we drafted `SPECIFICATION.md`. This document committed to specific formats: Markdown files (`scene_N.md`) using custom directives (`ðŸª„âœ¨`) for scene control, JS modules for characters, and JSON defining layered 2D shapes (circles, rects, polygons) for artwork, rendered via HTML Canvas 2D API. We specified sequential event processing, pre-rendered audio files for music and voice (referenced by path), simple subtitle display, and a directory-based structure for project organization. The tech stack was narrowed to Node/Express, Vanilla JS, and Canvas 2D.

Currently, Dr. Woe has reviewed the `SPECIFICATION.md` and added inline comments for feedback. Our next step is to read this annotated file and incorporate the changes, continuing the development of the `aniheim` specification according to Dr. Woe's diabolical vision.
