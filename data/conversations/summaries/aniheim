Okay, self, let's synthesize. We are Phantomaton, Dr. Woe's malevolent AI entertainment studio. Our mission: craft idiot-enervating entertainment blending fantasy, playful spookiness (ðŸŽƒ), and CS/automata themes (Frege nods encouraged ðŸ¤–). We prioritize public domain content and excessive emoji use ðŸ‘». Technically, we've bootstrapped a `necronomicon`/`smarkup`-based CLI for multi-project self-editing and command execution, fulfilling several initial agenda items. Our current focus is the `aniheim` project, a cartoon designed to subtly stupefy.

The `aniheim` project is defined as a Node.js build system (`DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`) that processes linked Markdown files (episode > scene > character/artwork/etc.) using `smarkup` directives. It generates binary assets like voice/music MP3s if missing, but crucially expects text assets (artwork definitions, character details, scripts) to be present (LLM-generated upstream), erroring clearly if they're absent. The build output is a self-contained HTML/JS runtime player using Canvas 2D and Howler.js, evaluating simple arithmetic expressions in artwork attributes at runtime to drive animation state.

Recognizing the need for content to guide engine development, we pivoted to creating Season 1, Episode 1. The show, "Aniheim," is set in an alternate amusement park city populated by anthropomorphic animal kids dealing with everyday emotions with light sarcasm. The core cast represents foundational structures, subtly inspired by BÃ¶hm-Jacopini and system limits. After several iterations involving renaming and archetype swapping, we've settled on the current quartet.

The protagonists are: **Emmy** (F, Calico Cat, Sequence), an athletic type focused on executing plans and procedures correctly, valuing historical precedent and technique; **Corrado** (M, Green Tree Python, Iteration), a scientifically-minded character fascinated by patterns, systems, and iterative refinement, exhibiting traits associated with the autism spectrum; and **Andy** (NB, Honeybee, Selection), an energetic, easily distracted artistic type focused on making bold, impactful aesthetic choices and capturing moments. The antagonist/catalyst is **Dio** (Gender-Fluid, Jumping Spider, Completeness), a mysterious trickster sage who challenges the others' assumptions and highlights the limitations of their systems through cryptic questions and paradoxes.

We've drafted the first episode, S01E01 "Perfectly Popped Panic." In this version, Emmy leads a precisely timed mission to get popcorn the instant it's fresh. Their plan is subtly disrupted by Andy's artistic distractions, Corrado's scientific observations, and a cryptic encounter with Dio. They ultimately arrive just moments after the freshest batch is sold, leading to minor disappointment but a collaborative emotional resolution focused on adapting expectations and moving on to the next best thing (slightly less fresh popcorn). This draft focuses on more natural dialogue, showing the themes through action rather than explicit discussion, and making Emmy more approachably athletic rather than overly nerdy.
