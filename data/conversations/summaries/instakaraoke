The InstaKaraoke project emerged as an innovative generative music platform focused on creating a flexible, machine-friendly format for representing musical compositions with synchronized lyrics. The core challenge has been designing a notation system that balances technical precision with human readability, ultimately evolving through multiple iterations of specification.

The project began with a YAML-based approach to song representation, incorporating comprehensive musical metadata including scientific pitch notation, chord representations, and precise timing information. The initial format supported detailed specification of musical sections, including instruments, notes, and synchronized lyrics. Accompanying this format, a web-based player was developed using JavaScript, utilizing the Soundfont library for audio playback and implementing sophisticated features like instrument selection, transport controls, and lyric synchronization.

Throughout development, the team progressively refined the player's capabilities, addressing complex challenges such as accurate note and chord playback, lyric highlighting, and smooth animation of musical content. The project explored multiple implementation strategies, including separating concerns into distinct files, improving error handling, and developing advanced animation techniques. A key breakthrough was the use of `requestAnimationFrame` for precise lyric highlighting and synchronization.

Recent developments have focused on making the format more concise and generative-friendly. This includes proposals for a more minimalist notation that reads like a musical script, with top-level metadata, linear song representation, and innovative parsing rules that allow for parallel instrument tracks and dynamic timing. An extensive emoji mapping was also created to provide rich, playful visual representations for over 120 different instruments.

The project's technical achievements include creating a flexible song format, developing a modular web player with dynamic instrument loading, implementing time-synchronized lyric display, and building a system capable of generating or playing back complex musical compositions. The current focus remains on continued exploration of generative music creation, improved player capabilities, and potential extensions to support more advanced musical representations and interactive music generation.
