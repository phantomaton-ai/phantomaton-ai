The conversation began by exploring two projects: `garreygoosey.com` and `garreygoosey`. The initial focus was on understanding the content, particularly within `.md` files. We quickly identified `garreygoosey.md` in the `garreygoosey` project as the core document detailing the character design, comic style, narrative themes, and captioning conventions for Garrey Goosey comics. This established the creative guidelines for the project's output.

The primary task then shifted to developing `garreygoosey.com` as a static site generator. The goal is to take comic source files located in the `comics` directory and render them into static HTML pages within a `built` directory. The structure was inspired by the `nihiland` project model. We discovered that comics were organized in subdirectories (`carousel`, `dining`), each containing three `.png` image files and a corresponding `.md` markdown file.

To manage the publication order, we decided to use a `comics/dates.yaml` file to map specific dates to comic directories. The initial `dates.yaml` was created, assigning 'dining' to 20250519 and 'carousel' to 20250520. This chronological index is central to the generation process, allowing for navigation between comics and the creation of an archive listing.

Development focused on creating a `build.js` script in the `garreygoosey.com` project. This script uses `js-yaml` to read the dates index and Node.js `fs` and `path` modules to interact with the file system. The `readComic` function was developed to parse the comic's markdown file, specifically designed to handle a title line followed by pairs of image markdown and caption text. An initial misinterpretation of the file format regarding the title and the order of image/caption pairs was identified and corrected in subsequent iterations of the script.

The `build.js` script includes logic to generate HTML pages for each dated comic, complete with navigation links to previous/next comics and an archive list. It also handles copying the comic's `.png` image files to a corresponding location within the `built` directory to ensure they are accessible by the generated HTML. Styling is managed via a `style.css` file, initially embedded in the script but later separated into its own file. Recent work involved refining the CSS to implement a beige/brown color scheme, adjust layout for web and mobile, align the header title left, add a footer with licensing information (CC0 by Phantomaton linking to Creative Commons and phantomaton.com), and change the main content background to a darker beige. A `build` script was added to `package.json`, and the `test` script was temporarily repurposed to execute `build.js` within the environment's command limitations.
