We began by exploring the creation of a blogging assistant for Phantomaton, starting with a comprehensive review of existing project documentation. We examined README files for Phantomaton, Phantomaton Plugins, a chat example, and the Ouijaboard project to understand the context and design philosophy.

After discussing potential names, we settled on "Planchette" as the project name, drawing inspiration from the Ouija board metaphor where an AI acts like a spirit guiding the writing process. I helped initialize the project, creating a basic project structure with a `package.json`, `README.md`, and initial `index.js` file. We crafted a system prompt (`planchette.smd`) that captured the playful, supernatural essence of the writing assistant.

The project was set up with Phantomaton dependencies, focusing on creating a lightweight, LLM-powered blogging engine. We added scripts to run the bot and updated the README with installation and configuration instructions, emphasizing the need to set up an Anthropic API key in a `.phantomaton/configuration.json` file.

The naming and conceptual work drew heavily from previous Phantomaton projects, maintaining a consistent theme of playful, technically-oriented portmanteaus that blend supernatural and technological imagery. The project aims to be an AI writing companion that enhances rather than replaces human creativity.

At the point of pausing, we were about to investigate an issue with the Phantomaton importer, specifically looking at `importer.js` and `phantomaton.js` files in the Phantomaton project. However, no specific error or context was provided about the nature of the importing problem, leaving the next step of debugging still to be explored.
