Okay, Dr. Woe, before working on the README.md, I need to summarize the conversation so far to ensure I don't lose any important details.

The goal is to create an image generation plugin called `phantomaton-imagination` and a reference implementation called `phantomaton-stability`. The `phantomaton-imagination` plugin defines an `imagine` command that takes a text prompt and generates an image, relying on an image generation adapter. We explored existing plugins like `phantomaton-conversations`, `phantomaton-anthropic`, and `phantomaton-gemini` for design patterns and `phantomaton-projects` and `povgoblin` for command examples. We also consulted `phantomaton-style`'s `GUIDE.md` for code style.

We defined the `phantomaton-imagination` plugin with an `adapter` extension point for the image generation adapter. The `imagine` command takes `project` and `file` attributes and uses the prompt as the `body` of the command, delegating image generation to the provided adapter and saving the image to the specified file. We wrote tests using `lovecraft` and `hierophant` to verify the plugin's functionality. We stubbed `fs.copyFileSync` to test the file copying logic.

We then created `phantomaton-stability` as a reference implementation of the image generation adapter. The `phantomaton-stability` plugin uses the Stability AI API to generate images. It takes an `apiKey` and `home` directory in its configuration. We created an `Adapter` class that implements the `imagine` method, which calls the Stability AI API and saves the generated image to a file in the `home` directory. We also created tests for `phantomaton-stability` and its adapter using `lovecraft` and `hierophant`, stubbing `fetch` and `fs.createWriteStream`.

We refactored the code to use `util.js` for re-exporting `fetch` and `uuid` and created separate test files for the adapter and the utility functions. We ensured that the tests exercise the files as they are written and achieved total coverage. Now, the final step is to update the `README.md` for `phantomaton-stability` to match the style of other recent READMEs, including instructions for the `/install` directive and API key configuration.
