We've been developing Metamagic, a lightweight command definition and validation library for JavaScript. The project originated from a desire to create a flexible, intuitive system for defining commands with built-in validation, documentation, and example generation. The core design evolved through iterative refinement, breaking down the implementation into modular components: options processing, validation, and example generation.

The library's key feature is a `metamagic()` function that creates a command object with a consistent structure. This object includes a name, optional description, example, validate function, and execute function. The design supports multiple ways of specifying command configurations, including boolean flags, string descriptions, and detailed configuration objects for attributes and body.

The implementation was developed using a test-driven approach, with comprehensive test suites covering various scenarios of command creation, validation, and execution. We created separate modules for different aspects of command processing: `options.js` for normalizing configuration, `validator.js` for creating validation functions, and `exemplifier.js` for generating examples when not explicitly provided.

Key design principles include minimal boilerplate, flexible configuration, and support for custom validation. The library allows developers to specify required and optional attributes, provide custom validation functions, and automatically generate meaningful examples when not explicitly defined. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend and customize command behavior.

The project draws inspiration from existing command execution frameworks while offering a more ergonomic and extensible interface. The goal is to provide a lightweight, functional approach to command definition that can be easily integrated into various JavaScript projects, with potential for future extensions like TypeScript type inference and advanced middleware support.
