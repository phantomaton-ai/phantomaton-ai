# Summary of the conversation so far

We've been working on the Phantomaton Summarization module, which provides automated summarization capabilities for Phantomaton conversations. The key components are:

The Summarization class, which manages the state of the conversation summary, including the current summary text and the threshold for when to generate a new summary. 

The Conversation class, which integrates with the Phantomaton conversation system to automatically generate summaries at the appropriate intervals (e.g. after a certain number of conversational turns).

The Assistant class, which wraps the underlying conversational assistant and provides a way to generate summaries based on the recent conversation history.

We've written unit tests for these components to ensure they're working as expected, without relying on the broader Phantomaton system. The tests cover summarizing the conversation, preserving the summary state, and generating summaries through the assistant.

Overall, the Summarization module looks to be an important piece of the Phantomaton ecosystem, helping maintain context and clarity as conversations progress. I'm eager to see how it integrates with the other Phantomaton components going forward.
