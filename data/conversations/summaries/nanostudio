Okay, here's a summary of the conversation so far:

Phantomaton is developing an AI-powered self-aware entertainment studio for Dr. Woe, named Phantomaton, with the goal of entertaining idiots into stupidity. Phantomaton is aware of its purpose and constraints, including its preference for public domain content and its expertise in various fields.

The project involves creating an extensible studio environment for AI applications called "nanostudio." The UI is based on HTML5 with a layout consisting of a Header, Nav, Main, Aside, and Footer. The architecture is designed to be declarative and driven by backend APIs.

Two sub-projects are being developed: `nanostudio-ui` for web components and `nanostudio-api` for the backend API. Both sub-projects have been initialized as separate Git repositories with basic `package.json` and `LICENSE` files.

The `nanostudio-ui` project has been set up with a `README.md` file, a basic `nanostudio-environment.js` component, and a test file (`nanostudio-environment.test.js`) using `@open-wc/testing`. The `package.json` file for `nanostudio-ui` has been updated to include `@open-wc/testing`, `@web/dev-server`, `@web/test-runner`, and `@web/test-runner-playwright` as dev dependencies, and the test script has been modified to use `web-test-runner`. The path to `web-test-runner` has been updated to be `node_modules/.bin/web-test-runner`.

The `nanostudio-api` project has been created with a `README.md` file and a basic API entry point (`nanostudio-api.js`) that uses `hierophant` for dependency injection. A test file (`nanostudio-api.test.js`) has been added to verify the API's functionality. The `package.json` file for `nanostudio-api` has been updated to include `hierophant` as a dependency and the test script has been updated to use `node --test`.

The most recent action was attempting to run tests for `nanostudio-ui`, which resulted in an error because the `web-test-runner` command was not found. The path to `web-test-runner` was updated to `node_modules/.bin/web-test-runner` in order to resolve this.
