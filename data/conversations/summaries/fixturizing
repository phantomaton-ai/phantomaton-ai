In this conversation, we've been working on the `smarkup` project, which is a lightweight markup language for embedding directives in plain-text documents. The project is part of the larger `phantomaton-ai` system, an AI-powered self-aware entertainment studio created by the evil Dr. Woe.

We began by familiarizing ourselves with the existing codebase, reviewing the `README.md` and `smarkup.js` files to understand the syntax and configuration options for the `smarkup` markup language. We then created the `smarkup.parse.js` and `smarkup.render.js` files to handle the parsing and rendering functionality, and updated the main `smarkup.js` file accordingly.

Next, we added a `description` property to each command in the `src/commands.js` file and updated the `src/prompt.js` file to include the description and example for each command. We also created the `smarkup.symbols.js` and `smarkup.symbols.test.js` files to manage the configuration of the `smarkup` symbols.

After ensuring the `smarkup` project was working as expected, we focused on improving the documentation of the `smarkup` syntax. We created the `smarkup.document.js` file and implemented the `Smarkup.document()` method to generate the documentation using the configured symbols. We also added more rigorous tests in `smarkup.document.test.js` to ensure the generated documentation covers both default and custom symbol configurations.

Finally, we updated the `smarkup.test.js` file to include an additional test case for generating documentation with custom symbols, and made some minor adjustments to the wording of the existing test cases to avoid using the word "should". We also worked on fixturizing the `smarkup.parse.test.js` file, removing the "should" from the `it` statements and using a `like` function to factor out the redundancy in the test cases. Additionally, we updated the `smarkup.render.test.js` file to reference the fixtures and use the same approach with the `like` function.
