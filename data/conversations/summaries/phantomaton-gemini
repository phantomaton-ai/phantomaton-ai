In this conversation, we began by initializing a new project called `phantomaton-gemini`, an adapter for the Google Gemini AI using the AI Studio API. We used the `phantomaton-anthropic` repository as a template, carefully examining its structure and implementation details.

The project involves creating several key files: `gemini.js` for the core API interaction, `phantomaton-gemini.js` for the Phantomaton plugin structure, and corresponding test files `gemini.test.js` and `phantomaton-gemini.test.js`. The implementation closely mirrors the Anthropic adapter, with adaptations specific to the Gemini API's request and response formats.

We followed a consistent pattern established in the Anthropic adapter, including error handling, API configuration options, and a flexible conversation method. The adapter supports system prompts, message history, and provides a robust interface for interacting with the Gemini language model through Google's AI Studio API.

A README.md was created for the project, maintaining the playful and slightly dark narrative tone characteristic of the Phantomaton project documentation. The README includes installation instructions, usage examples, and guidance on obtaining an API key from Google AI Studio.

The next planned step was to explore plugin documentation in the main Phantomaton repository, with the intention of potentially updating the README to more explicitly highlight the plugin capabilities of the Gemini adapter. This follows a pattern of incremental development and documentation refinement seen throughout the Phantomaton project ecosystem.
