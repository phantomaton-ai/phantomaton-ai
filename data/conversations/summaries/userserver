I've been helping implement test coverage for the "userserver" project, a Node.js server that exposes a JSON API for file operations. The API allows reading files/directories, writing files, creating directories, and executing commands through HTTP endpoints.

We started by reviewing the project structure, which consists of a Server class that handles HTTP requests using Express, along with supporting modules for path handling, endpoint creation, and shell command execution. We've been systematically creating test files for each component to achieve full test coverage.

So far, I've created test files for path.js, endpoint.js, shell.js, and server.js. While working on the tests, I discovered issues like missing await keywords that we fixed. For shell.test.js, we simplified our approach to test the promisified exec function without complex stubbing. With server.test.js, we faced challenges with properly stubbing Express and handling environment variables.

We've now shifted focus to improving the code's modularity. We created defaults.js to hold default configuration values (port: 3000, home: process.cwd()), and options.js to merge user-provided options with these defaults. We've also written corresponding test files for these new modules. This approach will help maintain a well-structured codebase and simplify option handling.

Our next steps involve updating the Server class to use these new option modules, passing the home directory option to Path via endpoint, and implementing safeguards to prevent path traversal attacks. We'll then continue with writing tests for userserver.js, likely using functional testing with a temporary directory.
