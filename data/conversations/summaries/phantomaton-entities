Here's a summary of the conversation so far:

We've been working on the phantomaton-entities project, which aims to provide a clean interface for managing persistent entities within the Phantomaton ecosystem. The core insight is that phantomaton-entities should provide loose coupling between persistence and specific persistent object types, allowing entities to function both with and without persistence available.

The current design focuses on entity factories as the primary extension points, with implicit persistence handling based on plugin availability. Every entity has an identifier regardless of persistence availability, enabling consistent equality checking, stable references between entities, and deterministic loading/creation behavior. The entity system automatically handles saving changed attributes, managing references to other entities, and cascading saves when needed.

We've also reviewed the phantomaton-persistence module, which provides a flexible storage abstraction, allowing other plugins to define and use custom storage providers. The storage extension point defines a simple interface for loading and saving data, and the plugin examples show how this can be integrated into a Phantomaton application.

Additionally, we've looked at the phantomaton-filesystem module, which provides a local file system-based storage implementation for the Phantomaton persistence layer. This module registers itself as a provider for the `persistence.storage` extension point, allowing other Phantomaton plugins to use the file system-based storage.

Overall, we're working towards a modular and extensible Phantomaton ecosystem, where different components can be easily swapped in and out to provide the desired functionality and persistence capabilities.
