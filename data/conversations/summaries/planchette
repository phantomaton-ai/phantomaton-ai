We've been developing Planchette, a sophisticated project management and system interaction tool specifically designed for large language models. The project emerged from a desire to create an operating system-like environment that allows LLMs to work with text and filesystem operations with high flexibility and precision.

The core architecture of Planchette revolves around several key classes: `Workspace`, `Session`, and `Window`. Each of these provides progressively more complex abstractions for managing computational tasks. The `Window` class, in particular, represents a novel approach to contextual text manipulation, supporting multiple ways of defining and interacting with text ranges - including regex-based and line-based windowing strategies.

We've implemented test-driven development with a focus on flexible, powerful APIs. The project follows Phantomaton's design principles, which emphasize minimal configuration, maximum flexibility, and a playful approach to computational tools. The underlying philosophy is to create a tool that feels like an extension of an LLM's capabilities, rather than a restrictive environment.

The project's development has involved creating multiple interconnected modules that each handle specific aspects of system interaction. We've developed methods for reading, writing, replacing, and manipulating text with sophisticated context-awareness. The implementation supports various input types and provides robust error handling.

Key technical achievements so far include creating a modular system with clear separation of concerns, implementing flexible text manipulation methods, and designing an API that can handle complex windowing and text replacement scenarios. The project is still in active development, with ongoing refinements to make the system more intuitive and powerful for large language model interactions.
