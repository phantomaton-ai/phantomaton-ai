Here is a summary of the conversation thus far:

The conversation began with you asking me to implement a `Smarkup` class that encapsulates parsing and rendering functionality for a simple markup language. The initial implementation focused on the `parse` method, which takes an input string and returns an array of directive objects. Each directive object has an `action`, `attributes`, and `body` property.

To test the parsing functionality, we added several unit tests covering different scenarios, including simple directives, directives with bodies, multiple directives, directives with missing bodies or arguments, and custom symbol configurations.

After the parsing implementation was complete, you asked me to add a `render` method to the `Smarkup` class. This method takes an array of directive objects and generates the corresponding markup string. I implemented the `render` method, ensuring that it could roundtrip the examples from the parsing tests.

To further verify the parsing and rendering functionality, I added a new set of tests in the `smarkup.test.js` file. These tests check that the output of the `render` method matches the original input, covering the same scenarios as the previous tests.

Finally, you asked me to update the `README.md` file to document the `parse` and `render` functions, as well as the configuration options and current limitations of the library. The updated README provides detailed examples and explanations of how to use the `Smarkup` class.

Overall, the conversation has focused on developing a reusable, configurable smarkup parsing and rendering library, with a strong emphasis on thorough testing and documentation. The key components of the library are the `Smarkup` class, the `parse` and `render` methods, and the ability to customize the symbols used in the markup language.
