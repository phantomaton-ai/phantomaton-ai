I've been working on improving the test coverage for the "planchette" project, which is a tool designed to help LLMs interact with files through a structured interface. The project follows a modular architecture with Sessions, Workspaces, Windows, and a command-based interaction model.

Initially, I fixed issues with the Window class implementation, addressing problems with cursor positioning, text selection, and scroll boundaries. These fixes ensured proper functionality for methods like before(), after(), select(), and drag(), which are critical for text manipulation. I successfully completed testing for the window.js module, fixing issues related to selection handling, text editing, and scroll boundaries.

I then implemented comprehensive tests for the workspace.js module, which manages multiple file windows. I opted for a streamlined approach that only stubbed the adapter while using real implementations for other components. The tests verify that the Workspace properly creates windows, manages focus between them, and correctly delegates to the adapter for file operations.

Next, I expanded test coverage for the commands.js module to ensure all validate functions were properly tested. Each command (open, close, focus, before, after, select, drag, edit, scroll) now has tests verifying both its validation logic and its execution behavior, achieving complete test coverage.

Finally, I created a thorough integration test for planchette.js that uses a temporary directory to exercise real file operations. These tests demonstrate complete workflows like opening files, navigating content, selecting and editing text, managing multiple files, and scrolling through content. I also wrote a comprehensive README.md explaining planchette's purpose, features, and usage patterns to provide clear documentation for the project.
