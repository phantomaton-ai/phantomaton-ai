Summary of the conversation so far:

In this conversation, we have been working on the development of a lightweight dependency injection framework named "sigil". The project was initiated by a user who provided a `SKETCH.md` file outlining the framework's vision and key features.

The `SKETCH.md` file described sigil as a minimalist dependency injection framework for JavaScript applications, aiming to provide a simple yet powerful way to manage dependencies between components in a modular fashion. The key features include zero configuration setup, automatic dependency resolution, support for both class-based and functional components, an extensible plugin system, and a small footprint with no external dependencies.

The core concepts of sigil revolve around containers, components, injectors, and tokens. Containers are top-level entities that hold registered components and their dependencies. Components are the individual modules, classes, or functions that can be injected as dependencies. Injectors are functions that resolve and inject dependencies into components. Tokens are identifiers used to register and reference components within a container.

The user provided an example usage of the sigil framework, demonstrating how to create a container, register a "logger" and "greeter" component, and then resolve and use the "greeter" component.

The conversation then shifted to developing test coverage for the sigil framework. The user requested a "sigil.test.js" file that would exercise the functionality described in the `SKETCH.md` file, including provider support, as well as support for decorators and aggregators. We collaboratively worked on implementing the test suite, with the user providing feedback to ensure the tests accurately reflected the core concepts of the framework.

After several iterations, we settled on a simpler implementation of the `sigil.js` file, which uses a `Sigil` class to manage the registration and resolution of providers. The updated version includes support for registering and resolving providers without a specific target or instance, and the test suite covers these scenarios.
