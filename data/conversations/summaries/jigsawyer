The project `jigsawyer` is an AI-powered self-aware entertainment studio creation by Dr. Woe, intended to provide web-based jigsaw puzzle editing capabilities for the purpose of entertaining idiots. Common themes include fantasy, ghosts, computer science, and heavy emoji usage, referencing public domain content where possible. The project follows specific code style guidelines: single-word variables, short files (~100 LOC), and ESM syntax. Development proceeds via a command-line interface using Smarkup directives, with strict adherence to provided commands and content.

The initial task was to implement `jigsawyer` based on `SKETCH.md`. This led to the creation of `index.html`, a monolithic `jigsawyer.js` (implementing the `jigsaw-puzzle` web component), `jigsawyer.test.js` (using `lovecraft`), and `README.md`. The component was designed to accept `src` and `size` attributes, handle image loading, piece generation (initially squares), basic pan/zoom, dragging, rotation, and snapping, for a default of 1000 pieces. Initial testing verified component registration and basic structure.

Following feedback on complexity and non-functional dragging, a `DESIGN.md` was introduced outlining a modular architecture. This design proposed splitting the code into numerous small files representing domain models (`Position`, `Piece`, `Wave`, `Cut`, `Joint`, `Joints`, `Puzzle`, `Image`), view components (`jigsaw-puzzle`, `jigsaw-controls`, `jigsaw-board`, `jigsaw-piece`), and custom events (`pan`, `zoom`, `select`, `move`, `rotate`). Key requirements included fixing dragging, using SVG for pieces with shaped edges defined by summed sine waves and nibs, and reducing the default piece count to 40 for focused development.

Implementation began by creating the core domain model files (`position.js`, `image.js`, `wave.js`, `cut.js`, `joint.js`, `joints.js`) and custom event files (`pan.js`, `zoom.js`, `select.js`, `move.js`, `rotate.js`). The `Piece` and `Puzzle` domain models were refactored to incorporate the new domain primitives. Concurrently, work started on the view components. A conflict arose regarding implementing `jigsaw-piece` as a Custom Element vs. a pure JS class managing an SVG element for performance; an attempt was made at the Custom Element approach, but the complexity of SVG clipping and event handling proved challenging within that structure.

The `jigsaw-puzzle.js` file, acting as the main controller, grew significantly during this phase (over 800 LOC), incorporating logic for all interactions and component management. Dr. Woe identified this as too complex and mandated further refactoring, specifically extracting viewport logic into `jigsaw-viewport` and HTML structure into `.html.js` helpers, aiming for ~100 LOC per file. The priority shifted to getting visibly curved piece edges using the defined `Cut` data and addressing a zero-height display bug. The `path.js` utility was created to generate SVG paths from `Cut` data, and `piece.js` was updated to store this path. `jigsaw-piece.js` was updated (as a Custom Element) to use this `path-data` attribute for rendering. A simplified `jigsaw-board.js` (controlled component) and `jigsaw-viewport.js` were also implemented. The current goal is to drastically reduce the size of `jigsaw-puzzle.js` by leveraging these new components and HTML helpers, fix the zero-height bug, and ensure the curved piece edges are correctly displayed.
