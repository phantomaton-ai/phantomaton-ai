We've been collaborating on a stick figure animation project. I initialized a new project called 'stick-figures' and created the foundational files including index.html, sticky.js, index.js, and index.css. The project's goal is to create animated stick figures that can be displayed in a browser.

The sticky.js file contains core functionality for generating stick figure poses and animation sequences. It exports functions like createStickFigure() which calculates joint positions based on input parameters, and createAnimationSequence() which generates animation frames for different actions like waving, walking, running, and jumping.

We refactored the drawing functionality into a separate draw.js file, which contains functions for rendering the stick figure to a canvas context. This separation maintains a clean architecture with the model (stick figure data) separate from the view (drawing). The most recent modification enhanced the drawing to include bulging muscles and expressive eyes, creating more character in the animations.

The index.js file serves as the controller, connecting everything together. It sets up a canvas, creates animation sequences, and implements playback controls like play/pause and reset. The animation loop iterates through pre-generated poses and renders each frame to create smooth motion.

The index.css file provides styling for the webpage, including layout, colors, and button styles. The complete application shows an animated stick figure in the browser with simple controls, and the figure can perform various animations like waving. The architecture is modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features or animation types.
