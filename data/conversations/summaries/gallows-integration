Summary of the conversation so far:

In this conversation, we have been working on creating a new project called "gallows", which is a lightweight command execution framework. We started by creating the project and defining the basic structure of the framework, including the usage, command properties, and command execution. 

We then updated the README to explain the command overloading feature, where multiple commands with the same name can be defined, and the first command that passes the `validate` function will be executed. To demonstrate this, we added an example of command overloading for the `echo` command.

Next, we created a test suite for the `gallows` project using Chai and Mocha, exercising the example from the README and adding a test for the command overloading feature.

After that, we implemented the `gallows.js` file, which contains the core logic for executing commands based on the provided `action`, `attributes`, and `body`.

We then reviewed the `src/projects.js` and `src/commands.js` files from the `phantomaton-ai` project, which provide project metadata and command definitions, respectively, using the `gallows` framework.

Finally, we started work on a new project called `phantomaton-projects`, which will expose the commands from `phantomaton-ai` in a `gallows`-compatible format, allowing them to be used like `const { commands } = phantomatonProjects(options);`.
