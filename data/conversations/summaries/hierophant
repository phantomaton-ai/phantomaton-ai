The conversation began with the development of Hierophant, a dependency injection container for the Phantomaton AI. The initial implementation featured a container that managed providers, aggregators, and decorators directly, using JavaScript Symbols as identifiers. This version demonstrated core DI container capabilities including dependency resolution, decorator chains, and provider aggregation strategies.

The implementation evolved through several rounds of testing, ensuring proper handling of edge cases like missing providers and multiple provider conflicts. The container's API included methods like provide(), decorate(), aggregate(), resolve(), depend(), and install(), allowing for both direct registration of components and batch installation of related providers, decorators, and aggregators.

A significant shift occurred when discussing alternative approaches to component identification and composition. Instead of having the container manage composition strategies directly, we explored moving this logic into "Sigil" objects - smart identifiers that encapsulate their own composition patterns. This addressed common DI framework issues around identifier collisions and role flexibility.

The final implementation features a minimal container (Hierophant) that only handles basic provider registration and dependency resolution, while Sigils manage their own extension points and composition logic. The base Sigil class provides implementation and resolution symbols, while specialized variants like Composite add support for decorators and aggregators. This keeps the container simple while maintaining all the previous functionality.

Throughout the conversation, we maintained strict test coverage of the implementation, demonstrating each feature through practical examples like a logging system and a conversational interface. The tests evolved alongside the implementation, ultimately showing how the same sophisticated dependency injection patterns could be achieved with a much simpler container by pushing composition logic into the Sigils themselves.
