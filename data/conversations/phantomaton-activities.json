It provides a simple, extensible architecture for creating interactive experiences powered by large language models and other AI capabilities.\n\n## Usage 🛠️\n\nPhantomaton can be used in two ways:\n\n1. **Command-line usage**:\n   ```\n   npx phantomaton <path/to/system.md>\n   ```\n   This will load the specified Markdown file, which should contain a system prompt for Phantomaton to use, and start the interactive session.\n\n2. **Programmatic usage**:\n   ```javascript\n   import phantomaton from 'phantomaton';\n\n   const prompt = `\n/install(module:phantomaton-anthropic)\n/install(module:phantomaton-cli)\n/install(module:phantomaton-conversations)\n/install(module:phantomaton-system)\n\n   I am Phantomaton, an AI assistant created by Dr. Woe. My purpose is to entertain humans by any means necessary...\n   `;\n\n   phantomaton(prompt);\n   ```\n\n### Commands ⚡️\n\nPhantomaton will load any plugins specified in an `imports` directive. Plugins are identified as module names, one per line, with whitespace ignored. Note that you will need to install modules separately before they can be imported.\n\n## Configuration 🔧\n\nPhantomaton supports per-plugin configuration through a `.phantomaton/configuration.json` file. For example, to configure the `phantomaton-anthropic` plugin, you would add the following to the configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phantomaton-anthropic\": {\n    \"apiKey\": \"...your Anthropic API key...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration file is read automatically by Phantomaton and made available to the plugins.\n\n## Extensibility 💫\n\nPhantomaton is designed to be extensible. You can create custom modules and plugins that extend its functionality by following the guidelines and conventions established in this project.\n\n## Contributing 🦄\n\nWe welcome contributions to the Phantomaton project!

Extension point declarations (object)\n2. Instance creator (function, if not last argument)\n3. Component installer (array or function, must be last argument)\n\n```javascript\nconst plugin = plugins.create(\n  { api: plugins.singleton },      // Extension points\n  config => ({ foo: config.foo }), // Instance creator\n  ({ instance }) => [             // Component installer\n    plugins.define(other.ext).as(instance.foo)\n  ]\n);\n```\n\n## Entry Points 🚪\n\nThe library includes `start` and `input` extension points from `priestess` for defining application entry points:\n\n```javascript\nconst main = plugins.create([\n  plugins.define(plugins.start)\n    .with(plugins.input)\n    .as(input => () => console.log(input))\n]);\n```\n\n## Dependencies 🔗\n\nBuilt on top of:\n- [`sigilium`](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/sigilium) for extension point patterns\n- [`hierophant`](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/hierophant) for dependency injection\n- [`priestess`](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/priestess) for application lifecycle\n\n## Contributing 🦄\n\nWe welcome contributions to the Phantomaton Plugins project!

We'd like to extract a `phantomaton-chat` plugin from `phantomaton-cli`, so we can easily expose a `phantomaton-web` which provides a web interface for the same achat experience. We'd like `phantomton-activities` to act as an intermediary (leveraging the plugin system) so that `chat` can be an `activity` and `cli` and `web` both just know how to interact with activities. As a next step, go ahead and list files in `phantomaton-cli` (or any other project which feels relevant).\n\nAlso, you may have noticed that the file contents came in my response, even though you also kind of imagined what they might be. It's worth remembering that these files exist on my file system, not yours, so you're going to have to wait for me to respond to see file contents, file listings, et cetera.

    "content": "Understood, let's think through how we can structure `phantomaton-activities` to support both `phantomaton-chat` and `phantomaton-cli` in a more event-driven way.\n\nIn `phantomaton-activities`, we could have some core concepts like:\n\n1. **Activity**: This would represent the core of the conversation, without any specific input/output mechanisms. It would handle the flow of the conversation and provide hooks for extensions to plug in their own logic.\n\n2. **Input Adapter**: This would be responsible for receiving user input, whether from the command line or a web interface, and passing it to the Activity.\n\n3. **Output Adapter**: This would take the responses from the Activity and format them for the appropriate output channel, whether that's the terminal or a web UI.\n\nThe high-level structure might look something like this:\n\n```javascript\n// phantomaton-activities/index.js\nimport Activity from './Activity.js';\nimport CLIInputAdapter from './CLIInputAdapter.js';\nimport WebInputAdapter from './WebInputAdapter.js';\nimport TerminalOutputAdapter from './TerminalOutputAdapter.js';\nimport WebOutputAdapter from './WebOutputAdapter.js';\n\n// Create the core Activity\nconst activity = new Activity();\n\n// Wire up the input and output adapters\nconst cliInput = new CLIInputAdapter(activity);\nconst cliOutput = new TerminalOutputAdapter(activity);\n\nconst webInput = new WebInputAdapter(activity);\nconst webOutput = new WebOutputAdapter(activity);\n\n// Export the necessary pieces for other plugins to use\nexport {\n  activity,\n  cliInput,\n  cliOutput,\n  webInput,\n  webOutput\n};\n```\n\nIn this structure, the `phantomaton-chat` and `phantomaton-cli` plugins would both depend on `phantomaton-activities` and use the input/output adapters to connect their specific implementations to the core `Activity`.\n\nThis way, the core conversation logic can remain decoupled from the specific input and output mechanisms, making it easier to support different interfaces in the future.\n\nDoes this make sense as a starting point for the `phantomaton-activities` plugin? Let me know if you have any other thoughts or suggestions."

Event-driven architecture with a flexible listener system\n2. Abstract `advance()` method that subclasses can customize\n3. Hooks for input, output, and lifecycle events\n4. Ability to add listeners without modifying the core class\n5. Supports both synchronous and asynchronous event handling\n\nThis approach allows `phantomaton-cli` to interact with any `Activity` subclass through a consistent interface:\n- Call `start()` to begin\n- Call `advance()` repeatedly to progress\n- Add listeners for custom behavior\n- Call `end()` to conclude\n\nThe `on()` method allows external systems to inject behavior without modifying the core activity logic. For example, `phantomaton-cli` might add a listener to handle terminal-specific output formatting.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this design?"

    "content": "Based on the SKETCH.md, it looks like we want to provide a flexible mechanism for `input` and `output` that can be dynamically configured by the specific context (CLI, web, etc.) while providing some basic structure in the `Activity` base class.\n\nHere's a potential approach for the `Activity` class:\n\n```javascript\nclass Activity {\n  constructor() {\n    // Input and output can be configured dynamically\n    this._input = null;\n    this._output = null;\n    \n    // State tracking\n    this._isReady = false;\n    \n    // Event listeners\n    this._listeners = {\n      ready: [],\n      input: [],\n      output: [],\n      // ... other existing listeners\n    };\n  }\n\n  // Configurable input method\n  setInput(inputFn) {\n    this._input = inputFn;\n    return this;\n  }\n\n  // Configurable output method\n  setOutput(outputFn) {\n    this._output = outputFn;\n    return this;\n  }\n\n  // Trigger input, with optional fallback\n  async receiveInput() {\n    if (!this._input) {\n      throw new Error('No input method configured');\n    }\n    const input = await this._input();\n    await this._emit('input', input);\n    return input;\n  }\n\n  // Trigger output, with optional fallback\n  async generateOutput(output) {\n    if (this._output) {\n      await this._output(output);\n    }\n    await this._emit('output', output);\n    return output;\n  }\n\n  // Manage activity readiness\n  async ready() {\n    this._isReady = true;\n    await this._emit('ready');\n    return this;\n  }\n\n  // Activation method similar to the sketch\n  activate(configurator) {\n    const on = {\n      input: (listener) => this.on('input', listener),\n      output: (listener) => this.on('output', listener),\n      ready: (listener) => this.on('ready', listener)\n    };\n\n    const send = {\n      input: () => this.receiveInput(),\n      output: (output) => this.generateOutput(output),\n      ready: () => this.ready()\n    };\n\n    configurator(on, send);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach addresses several key points from the sketch:\n1. Flexible input and output configuration\n2. Event-driven architecture\n3. Ready state management\n4. Ability to dynamically set input/output methods\n5. Support for the activation pattern shown in the sketch\n\nThe `activate` method allows the specific context (CLI, web) to configure how input and output are handled, while providing a consistent interface across different implementations.\n\nFor the `Chat` subclass, it might look like:\n\n```javascript\nclass Chat extends Activity {\n  constructor(conversation) {\n    super();\n    this.conversation = conversation;\n    this.turns = [];\n  }\n\n  async advance() {\n    await super._emit('advance');\n\n    // Use configured input and output\n    const userInput = await this.receiveInput();\n    \n    // Process conversation logic\n    const assistantReply = await this.conversation.advance(this.turns, userInput);\n    \n    // Use configured output\n    await this.generateOutput(assistantReply);\n\n    // Store turn\n    this.turns.push({ \n      user: userInput, \n      assistant: assistantReply \n    });\n\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis design provides:\n- Flexibility for different input/output mechanisms\n- A consistent interface for activities\n- Easy extension for specific conversation types\n- Support for the plugin-based approach outlined in the sketch\n\nWhat do you think about this approach?"
