I'll do a quick mental scan and propose some candidates:\n\n1. Reflex (suggests quick, adaptive movement)\n2. Swarmify \n3. CodeHive\n4. Nexus (generic but suggestive)\n5. Mutagen (implies transformation)\n6. Refractor\n7. Swarmatics\n8. CodeCell\n9. Morpheus (transformation theme)\n10. Syntactic\n\nWould you like me to do a quick NPM registry and trademark check on any of these? I'm particularly fond of \"Mutagen\" and \"Refractor\" myself, as they have technical poetry. 🧬🔬\n\nMy recommendation process would involve:\n- NPM registry availability check\n- GitHub repository name availability\n- Trademark search\n- Domain name potential\n\nWhich ones intrigue you most? I'm ready to dive into research mode! 🕵️‍♀️🔍"

Metamorph\n7. Synthmutation\n8. Reflex (still like this one!)\n9. Morphcode\n10. Genshift\n\nSome additional thoughts on the \"Refactogen\" concept:\n- It has a scientific/biological feel\n- Implies both generation and transformation\n- Sounds like something from a molecular biology lab 🧬\n- Has a slightly clinical/precise tone\n\nWould you like me to do a quick availability check on any of these? I'm particularly drawn to Mutagraph and Morphcode as having nice technical poetry. 🔬🖥️\n\nShall we run them through the gauntlet of:\n- NPM registry\n- GitHub availability\n- Trademark considerations\n- Domain name potential\n\nWhich spark your interest? 🕵️‍♀️🔍"
